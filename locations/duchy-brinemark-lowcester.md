# Duchy of Lowcester — House Brinemark of Saltmarch

## Overview
The fifth line received the storm‑gnawed lowlands and their bustling ports — the least prized at the Partition, now a rough‑and‑ready engine of trade. House Brinemark thrives in hard weather and harder bargains.

## Seat and Holdings
- Seat: `Saltmarch` — a breakers‑guarded harbor town of shipyards, ropewalks, and sea‑shrines.
- Core Holdings: Lowcester Marches, Stormbar Breakers, Driftport Chain, and the Quays of Nine Flags.
- Notables: The Black Gull Docks, the Anchor Court (maritime law), and the Wrecklight.

- Colors: Charcoal, sea‑green, and salt‑white.
- Motto: “In Rough Seas, Profit.”

- Heir Apparent: Kane Brinemark (14), apprenticed to the ropewalk, keen eye for knots and numbers.
- Notable Kin: Aunt Vessa, admiral of the Letter‑of‑Marque Fleet.

## Court and Culture
- Tide‑tables and tavern councils; oaths sworn on salt and storm.
- Ship‑launch festivals double as recruitment and debt jubilee events.

## Economy and Assets
- Shipbuilding, salt, fish, and exchange of “brown goods” the other duchies pretend not to see.
