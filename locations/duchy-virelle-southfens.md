# Duchy of the Southfens — House Virelle of Miregate

## Overview
The second line chose the city life among warm marshes and winding canals. House Virelle rules a Venice‑meets‑New‑Orleans metropolis of lanternlit festivals, masked guilds, levees, and music. Wealth flows through celebrations, tariffs, and risk.

## Seat and Holdings
- Seat: `Miregate` — a delta city on stilts and stones, with grand plazas and narrow waterways.
- Core Holdings: Southmarsh Canals, Festival Quarters, Tide‑Locks, and the Night Orchid Market.
- Notables: The Lantern Parade, The Hall of Masks (guild conclave), and the Floodward Tower.

## Heraldry
- Sigil: A silver heron bearing a lantern above blue waves and reeds.
- Colors: Azure and silver, with lantern‑gold.
- Motto: “Where the Lantern Leads.”

## Line and Succession
- Founder: Prince Lucent Virelle, the Second.
- Current Ruler: Duke Matthieu Virelle (52), charming, calculating patron of guilds.
- Consort: Lady Rosamonde (46), a famed festival choreographer.
- Heir Apparent: Lady Seraphine Virelle (24), mask‑maker and deft diplomat.
- Notable Kin: Cousin Pierro, guild auditor with too many favors owed.

## Court and Culture
- Masks, music, and mercantile wit; every deal is a performance.
- Festivals double as political summits; secrets are traded like spices.
- Floodward priests bless levees; storm‑chanters hired during cyclone season.

## Economy and Assets
- Tariff control at river mouths, spice and silk import, festival licenses, exotic crafts.
- Shadow economy: sanctioned smuggling in “gray lanes” to keep coin moving.
- Strategic asset: Tide‑Lock Consortium that can stall or surge river traffic.

## Settlement Tiers (est.)
