# Duchy of Greenwold — House Evermead of Highspire

## Overview
The eldest line of King Marrec’s sons holds the lush heartlands and the Old Capital. House Evermead presides over the breadbasket that feeds the entire Horseshoe and the bureaucracy that once served a single crown. Their rule is orderly, pragmatic, and quietly ambitious.

- Seat: `Highspire` — the former royal capital, now a ducal city of granaries, counting houses, and archives.
- Core Holdings: Greenbarrow Plains, River Yarrow bends, Highspire Crown District, the Royal Granaries (now Ducal).
- Notables: The Ledger Court (civil clerks), the Hall of Weights (standards), and the Old Crown Gate.

## Heraldry
- Sigil: A golden wheat‑sheaf beneath an open crown on green.
- Colors: Harvest gold and field green.
- Motto: “We Feed the Realm.”

## Line and Succession
- Founder: Prince Aldren Evermead, the Eldest.
- Current Ruler: Duchess Elowen Evermead (38), meticulous and reform‑minded.
- Consort: Lord Harwick of Yarrowbridge (41), a logistics savant.
- Heir Apparent: Lord Corin Evermead (17), idealistic, studies old royal charters.
- Notable Kin: Aunt Merevi (archivist who knows the Writ’s missing clauses).

## Court and Culture
