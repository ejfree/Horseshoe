Overview
- Nearest market town downstream from Hookhill. Sits on a broad bend where the Grey Sluice’s cold headwaters gather into a navigable river. Everything cut or dug in Hookhill passes through Sluicebend on its way to the wider world.
- Timber rafts nose in at the booms; ore sacks get tallied, stamped, and re‑loaded into barges. The air smells of wet rope, tar, and sawdust.

Population
- ~3,500 within walls; ~8,000 in reach (hamlets, ferries, mills).
- Swells during thaw and festival weeks as barge trains stack up at the locks.

Location & Access
- Region: High Marches, lower valley from Hookhill.
- Approaches: a cart road from Hookhill along the east bank; ridge track to clan passes; river barges down to the low duchies.
- River Works: paired timber booms, a low stone quay, and a two‑gate tide/flow lock sized for barge pairs.

Economy
- Transshipment hub for upland timber, pit‑props, and mixed ore pockets.
- Millworks (grist and saw), ropewalk, coopers, tar kilns, and boatyards for river barges.
- Trade out: bundled planks, ore casks, charcoal, hides. Trade in: grain, salt, lamp oil, cloth, tools, coin‑change and letters of standing.

Authority & Order
- Civic: Burgess Council of Wharfmasters (booms, boathouse, ropewalk) chaired by a market reeve; lockwardens run the gates and post flows.
- Church: a busy Bond Hall with two clerks and a small odds counter; weighs cargo, witnesses contracts, and keeps the Sluicebend standing book.
- Law: River Wardens patrol quays and booms; levy can muster ~200 with bills and a handful of arbalests.

Defenses
- Stone quay with bollards and a chain‑boom across the bend; signal tower with horn and shutter lights.
- Lock gates can be spiked; booms can be thrown to foul hostile craft.

Notables
- Market Reeve Halben Cross — brisk, ink‑sure; hates queue‑jumpers more than thieves.
- Lockwarden Sura Dell — riverwise, superstitious about flood bells; knows every barge captain’s tells.
- Bargewright Pella Jute — runs the boatyard; fair quotes, fierce about safety.
- Toll Clerk Brin Allet (Bondwright) — calm, exacting; settles scale disputes without fuss.
- Wharfmaster “Old” Tren Goss — missing three fingers, gains three friends every night at the Boomsman.
- Factor Neris Vaunt — low‑duchy buyer; pays decent coin for clean billets and true‑weight sacks.

Landmarks
- The Weighhouse: iron‑balanced scales under a high roof; chalkboards list posted measures and house edge for the odds counter.
- Chain‑Boom Pier: stout posts and winches where the river boom is raised and lowered; wardens swap stories here at dusk.
- Lock Gates: twin timber gates with stone cheeks; bronze depth rods marked with flood years.
- Boathouse Row: covered sheds for barge repair; the air is tap‑tap‑tap and pitch.
- Bond Hall of Sluicebend: copper seal on the lintel; two desks always occupied, even late.
- The Boomsman: tavern with a river chart above the bar and a horn mounted on the wall that no one blows lightly.

Key Locations
- Timber Yards: rafts broken, bundles made, brands burned; tally lines in the mud.
- Ore Stamp & Caskers: hand stamp and small trip‑hammer; ore graded and loaded into ring‑hooped casks.
- Ropewalk & Coopers’ Lane: long shed where rope is laid; coopers’ hammers never quite stop.
- Ferries & Stairs: broad stone steps with ferry poles and winter chains stacked high.
- Factor Warehouses: leased bays with bonded locks; guards hired on festival weeks.

Ties to Hookhill
- Standard run: Hookhill → Sluicebend in a long day with a decent mule team; two if thaw bogs the road.
- Contracts posted in Hookhill pay out at Sluicebend’s Weighhouse when witnessed by the Bond Hall.
- Names that carry between towns: Reeve Mera Holth and Market Reeve Halben Cross trade letters; Sister Ellin’s seal is trusted at Sluicebend for small Bonds.

Threats & Pressures
- Spring floods can snap booms; one bad thaw jams the lock for days.
- Queue wars: rival barge captains bribe dockmen to jump the lock turn.
- Goblin scouts seen in reed beds across the bend; wardens want better lamps.

Adventure Hooks
- Boom Night: a chain‑boom pin goes missing on a flood watch; find it before a raft train slams the quay.
- Scale War: someone salts ore sacks with river stones; catch the ring before Evermead auditors close the Weighhouse.
- Lock in Dusk: a captain vanishes mid‑transit; his barge drifts, lantern lit, crew silent.

Notes
- Sluicebend is written to pair with Hookhill’s smaller frontier profile; adjust throughput and council clout if your Hookhill uses the larger population from cities.md.
