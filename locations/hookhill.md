title: Hookhill
slug: hookhill

Overview
- Starting village for the PCs. A small, hardwearing settlement tucked in a narrow valley near the Grey Sluice headwaters in the High Marches.
- The surrounding peaks are dark grey‑black; northwest ridges remain snow‑capped most of the year. The valley floor is cut by cold streams that feed the Sluice.

Population
- ~1,000 within the palisade (initial census).
- Outlying cutters’ camps and mine shacks add another ~300–500 seasonally.

Location & Access
- Region: High Marches. The Grey Sluice proper lies several miles outside town, up‑valley in the mountains; it is not in Hookhill itself.
- The Sluice near Hookhill is a chain of stepped channels and “stone stair” spillways that runs for several miles deeper into the range, one of many such systems scattered across the Horseshoe’s mountains.
- Approaches: a single cartable track along the streambank; goat paths rise to timber cuts; a rough switchback trail reaches an old ore landing.

Economy
- Timber and rough‑cut lumber from high slopes; pit‑props and charcoal.
- Small‑scale mining (iron bloom, mixed ore pockets) and stone quarrying.
- Trade out: billets, planks, ore sacks; trade in: grain, salt, cloth, tools.

Authority & Order
- Civic: a reeve and a small council of guild foremen (cutters, pit bosses, ferriers). The reeve maintains ledgers and posts contracts under Bondwright witness at market days.
- Church: a modest Bond Hall with a single clerk who witnesses Horseshoe Bonds, keeps the village standing book, and arbitrates minor disputes.

Defenses
- Timber palisade with ditch and two gate‑stiles; alarm horns at the yard and the ford.
- Levy of ~80 able bodies with woodspears and bucklers; a handful of old arbalests on the yard’s walk.

Notables (seeds)
- Reeve (name your pick) — practical, keeps the books straight, sleeps poorly.
- Head Cutter — owns three teams, knows every ridge path and windfall.
- Old Pit Boss — coughs slate, swears there’s a richer seam under the east wall.
- Bondwright Clerk — steady hand with the seal; keeps quiet tabs on who owes whom.

Important People
- Reeve Mera Holth — flax‑grey braid, watchful; keeps ledgers and postings under Bondwright witness. Goal: keep winter stores full and the levy sober. Hook: asks the PCs to witness a contested timber claim across Ghostfall Creek.
- Head Cutter Dorn Bracken — scarred forearms, slate eyes; runs three cutter teams. Goal: secure a new stand beyond the old stormbreak. Hook: needs guards to escort a saw team to a risky upslope cut.
- Pit Boss Igan Rusk — old, cinder cough; swears the Eastwall seam still runs rich. Goal: reopen a shored‑up drift without spooking the council. Hook: hires hands to clear a cave‑in before rivals seize his claim.
- Clerk Sister Ellin Torv (Bondwright) — steady hand with the seal; calm voice. Goal: keep debts fair and tempers cool. Secret: quietly advances grain to widows and injured hands from her own stipend.
- Galla “Greenglass” Venn — proprietor of the Greenglass bunkhouse and tavern; ex‑cutter. Goal: keep beds full and scrip circulating. Hook: wants a stolen cask and ledger page recovered from camp thieves.
- Tamber Kett — ferrier and smith; broad‑backed, burns bright coke when he can get it. Goal: replace cracked arbalest prods on the yard’s walk. Hook: pays in tools for a wagon of quality charcoal.
- Pip Fen — itinerant assayer with a boxed scale and acid vials. Goal: stay on the right side of every foreman. Hook: offers a finder’s fee for samples from a “green‑spark” pocket upslope.
- Sefa Wren — bonesetter and midwife; keeps a shelf of tinctures and a clean saw. Goal: stop the fever running the bunkhouse. Hook: needs safe escort to a charcoal ring where medicinal bark grows.

Landmarks
- Market Yard: post for contracts, measure stones, and the palisade’s mustering green.
- Sluice Ford: braid of cold streams at the valley’s lip; easy to defend, treacherous in thaw. The first “steps” of the Grey Sluice are miles upstream from here.
- Monolith Cellar: a natural cavern beneath the reeve’s house, where a seamless terraforming monolith lies half‑buried in stone.

Key Locations
- Cutters’ Yard: racks for saws and peaveys, measure poles set in the mud, and a whip‑saw frame for rough planks. The alarm horn hangs under the yard’s eave.
- Greenglass Tavern & Bunkhouse: long tables, stew on the boil, straw ticks three high; scrip ledger behind the bar and a lockbox under the floor.
- Ore Landing & Stamp: a switchback platform where ore sacks are tallied and a hand stamp crushes promising rock; mule teams take the rest down‑valley.
- Eastwall Drift: half‑shored mine mouth with a wet breeze; danger signs of bad air and slipping timbers — Rusk’s men keep it quiet.
- Charcoal Rings: low earth mounds smoldering under turf caps; burns run hot and quiet for days. Firebreaks cut to the creek.
- Smithy & Ferrier: near the gate‑stile; shoeing stocks, nail bins, and a battered arbalest bench on the side.
- Foremen’s Tally Shed: chalkboard of contracts due, scrip chits paid, and a board for day‑men looking for a team.
- Physic’s Bothy: Sefa’s low hut with clean water barrels, a splint rack, and a curtain for the grim work.

The Hollow Engine (GM)
- Nature: early terraforming gear that drinks ambient resonance; the “obelisk” is a control monolith linked to an auxiliary lattice node.
  - Terminology: locals once called it an obelisk; Bondwright texts now refer to it simply as the Monolith.
- Discovery: found generations ago when the reeve’s foundations broke into a natural chamber. The village knows “there’s old metal under the hall,” but not its purpose.
- Trigger: when the party brings the first sliver of aetherite within close reach, the monolith “wakes,” projecting a display that adapts to the viewers and offers privileged access.
- Function at table: a story valve to solve the initial raid, buy time, and enable escape. A straight stand‑up fight to the last will destroy Hookhill.

Monolith Tech Notes (GM)
- Build: seamless composite; no fasteners, joints, or service seams; matte finish resists tool marks.
- Resonance: low sub‑audible hum; surface warm to the touch but constant across seasons.
- Interface: projects adaptive glyphs; accepts proximity keys (slivers) and spoken commands once “taught” Names.
- Power: harvests ambient aether; can spike draw briefly at risk of local Hollow feedback if throttles are lifted.
- Connectivity: uplink handshake to lattice authority “Big Red” fails; status reads LOST CONTACT — operating in Autonomous Mode (Safeguards ON).
- Safeguards: caps on flow‑alteration, thermal output, and seismic impulse; overrides require multi‑factor keys the party does not yet possess.
- Logs: last successful central sync “centuries” ago; local maintenance timers long expired; fault list mainly comms timeouts and corroded conduit warnings.

Grey Sluice Network (GM)
- Nature: an artificial cascade network built by the terraformers to seed and stabilize river sources and ensure continuous flow, even in lean seasons.
- Extent: the “Grey Sluice” by Hookhill is one segment of a wider lattice of sluices repeating all across the Horseshoe’s mountain rims.
- Control: automated flow governance anchors back to an ancient routine in the center of “Big Red.” Intervening manually at local sluices is difficult without tripping safeguards.

Threats & Pressures
- Goblin scouts have tested the palisade twice this season; drums heard on clear nights.
- Spring thaw undermines the ford; a bad flood could cut the only cart road for weeks.
- Ore pockets are thinning; cutters push farther upslope into risky country.

Adventure Hooks
- Root Access: the monolith offers a handful of stark choices to divert, blind, or terrify raiders — but each choice has a cost the village will feel later.
- Sluice Stones: engraved “steps” appear in the stream after a storm; following them might reveal a safer pass — or a goblin under‑way.
- Bond at Risk: a mine accident leaves a foreman in default; rivals circle to seize his teams unless the party finds collateral or leverage.

Notes
- This file reflects the starting brief (1,000 pop, High Marches setting). If using the broader cities.md population for Hookhill, scale the yard, levy, and market accordingly.
