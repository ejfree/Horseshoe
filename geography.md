Scope & Map Sketch
- Canonical Coastline: use `maps/horseshoe-landmass.png` as the exact land/sea boundary for all references in this file (north at top).
- World: Calderos. This document focuses on the Horseshoe landmass where the campaign begins (Hookmarch region and surrounds).
- The Horseshoe: a horseshoe-shaped landmass. Impenetrable mountains wall the North and West; an inner sea (the Calder) opens south to the world ocean at the bay mouth shown on the map.
- North/West Range: the Ironcradle (high, glaciated) and the Blackjaw (jagged basalt, riddled with underways). Few passes; most are goblin-held.
- Inner Sea: the Calder Sea; brackish in coves, deep and storm-prone in its throat to the world ocean.
- Beyond the Ironcradle, lands continue further north; the Horseshoe is not the world’s northern edge.

Map-Anchored Notes
- Ironcradle: follows the outer north rim from the broad northwest shoulder to the northeast headland on the image.
- Blackjaw: tracks the outer west rim from the northwest shoulder down to the southwestern horn.
- The Throat: the narrow southern mouth where the inner sea meets the world ocean, between the western and eastern horns visible on the map.
- Hookmarch: the northwest corner along the inner coast just east of the Blackjaw; set near the northern end of the inner sea’s curve.
- High Fens: arc around the north bend of the inner sea below the Ironcradle.
- Greenfold: spans the inner east coast from the north bend down toward the Throat.
- Ember Coast: all south-facing outer shores on both horns, including the approaches to the Throat.
- Vales of Skyglass: the high northeast terraces backing the inner east coast, below the Ironcradle.

Major Regions
- The Barrowmarch (West & Northwestern Hill Country): baronies on old burial mounds and rolling hills; foggy moors; barrow-wights and smugglers. Frontier to goblin raids.
- The Hookmarch (Northwest Corner, Barrowmarch by oath): limestone hill country tucked against Blackjaw; vineyards on warm slopes, quarries, karst caves, and hidden underways. Hookhills (the town) sits here near the Grey Sluice headwaters.
- The High Fens (North Bend): peatlands draining glaciers; hardy peat-cutters and spear-fishers; stilt-villages.
- The Greenfold (East Inner Coast): grain-rich plains and vineyards; merchant leagues; river routes to the sea.
- The Ember Coast (South Rim): warmer coves, salt pans, and shipyards; fisher-priests keep Ember shrines for safe tides.
- The Vales of Skyglass (North-East Shoulders): elf-ruins terraced into high valleys; bridges of translucent “skyglass.”

Notable Features
- The Throat: narrow straits where the Calder meets the world ocean; fog, wreckers, and sea-serpents.
- The Grey Sluice: glacier-fed headwaters in the Hookmarch cut down through the Barrowmarch into the Calder.
- The Stone Ladder: switchback pass over Blackjaw, usable late summer—when goblins also mass.
- “Starfall” Fields (misnamed): blast-scattered aetherite zones from ancient vault breaches—lush, wrong, and tightly policed.

Climate
- With further lands continuing north and a warm current entering the Calder from the southeast, winters across the Horseshoe lowlands are generally mild; summers run hot, especially in the Greenfold and the Hookmarch.
- Alpine zones (Ironcradle/Blackjaw) remain severe year-round; high passes can still close after storms even in “mild” winters.

Travel Notes
- Overland: 15–18 miles/day on roads; 8–12 in wilds. Passes often close in winter.
- Coastal: fast but weather-volatile; Ember Coast offers safest hugging routes.
 - Heat Haze: summer travel in the Hookmarch/Greenfold suffers from water scarcity and mirage—plan wells and start early.

GM Map Tags (drop on your map)
- [Vault-Σ3] Hidden terraforming substation under Barrowmarch barrow.
- [Skyglass Bastion] Elven cliff-fortress dominating the Vales.
- [Shard Market] seasonal black market on a floating barge in the Greenfold.
- [The Hollow Engine] buried beneath the starting town; predates current settlement.

Beyond the Horseshoe (Teasers)
- Far North: The Overstep — a high, wind-scoured plateau beyond the Ironcradle. Summer-only caravan routes skirt glaciers; rumors speak of steppeholds that ride alongside migrating auroras.
- Western World-Ocean: The Sable Gyre — a slow, clockwise current carrying ships toward pepper isles and red-clay continents. Return voyages fight headwinds and need stout hulls and spare masts.
- South of the Throat: The Saltspires — limestone pillars and labyrinthine shoals; wreckers light false stars; a semi-mythic port, Greyhaven, buys charts with gold and silence.
- Eastern Reach: Dorsal Isles — knife-backed volcanic islands where skyglass beacons once triangulated routes; most beacons are dark, a few sing at odd hours.
- Distant Mainland: The Sunken Lattice — mariners tell of a coast studded with drowned pylons like teeth. Some claim shard-caches still hum beneath the surf; few return with proof.

Winds & Currents
- Ember Stream (warm): flows into the Calder from the southeast; moderates Horseshoe winters and drives spring trade north along the Ember Coast.
- Greyback Current (cold): tumbles down from the northern seas along the Ironcradle, fueling fogs and sudden squalls.
- Throat Gales: seasonal, funneling winds that can pin fleets for weeks or tear them to kindling in a night.

GM Hooks (Beyond)
- A Veilport factor offers Letters of Marque to chart a safe line through the Saltspires to Greyhaven.
- Elven wardens quietly sponsor a beacon-rekindling in the Dorsal Isles; the lit beacon might wake something older.
- A sailor brings a barnacle-encrusted casing that hums like a Sliver—if true, it could shift power far beyond the Horseshoe.
