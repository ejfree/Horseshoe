Ages of Calderos

- Arrival & Survey (Year 0–10): Second Diaspora flotilla makes planetfall. Calderos is cold — a world at the outer edge of the habitable zone. Ten years of survey and seeding sites.
 - Terraforming Era (Year 10–1010): Climate engines, current shapers, and an aether lattice are brought online to warm the world and stabilize weather. Five Designers divide remit: four oversee major land divisions; the fifth builds the floating resort/command city, Nevegas, on the inner sea.
   - Named Designers: Tamsin Kade (Stonewright — West Rim hydrology); Yelena Arora (Frostline — North Bend cryosphere); Koji Nakata (Greenband — East agroclimate); Malik Okoye (Emberstream — South maritime); Mira Solace (Dealer — Nevegas hub & standards).
- The Sundering (Year 1010–1150): Lattice failure cascades. Resonance storms shred cities; custodian minds fragment; aetherite stores spoil into Hollow shards. Nevegas is crippled and later sinks to the Frog’s floor.
- Long Night (Year 1150–3200): Warlords, witch‑kings, barrow cults. Elves retreat to skyglass vales with surviving armories; the craft of aetherite dwindles and is lost. Oath rites spread to hold communities together.
- Remnant Age (Year 3200–present): Feudal orders stabilize; merchant leagues rise. Rationing and salvage replace fabrication. Rumors grow of custodians’ return as liches and machine‑ghosts.

Material Reality
- Only Slivers and a vanishing few Shards remain in circulation; lesser forms like Dust, or greater forms such as Prisms, or Hearts are unknown in the present age.

Known Catastrophes
- The Blackjaw Howl: a winter when mountain underways sang; every open flame blew green; thousands deafened or maddened.
- The Dimming: decade of weak stars; aether‑users failed or cracked; oath rites (early Bondwright practice) spread to hold communities together.
- The Sinking of Nevegas: the floating city’s hulls tore under resonance stress during the Sundering; its platforms broke and went down over days, leaving a graveyard of anchors and towers on the Frog’s floor.

Recent History (last 20 years)
- Skyglass Skirmishes: elven wardens clash with prospectors near old lifts.
- Barrowmarch Consolidation: petty barons bend knee to a March-Lord for mutual defense.
- Shard Tithes: leagues and lords formalize taxes on aetherite to fund roads and levies.

GM Secrets
- The lich “Verran the Pale Archivist” bound his mind to Hollow cores after the Sundering. He seeks a First-Landing sub-reactor hidden beneath the starting town to bootstrap a new lattice and restart aetherite fabrication under his control.
- Goblin clans long kept fragments of custodian tech as totems; a captured Warden taught them crude Hollow song—now their shamans can pilot corrupted resonance.
