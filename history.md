Ages of Calderos

- First Landing (ca. 0–200): Colonial arrival; fabricated aetherite and lattice raise breathable winds, tame tides; foundational cities seeded. Custodian minds manage archives and infrastructure.
- The Sundering (ca. 200–350): Lattice failure cascades; storms of resonance shred cities; custodians fragment; aetherite stores spoil into Hollow shards. Survivors scatter.
- Long Night (ca. 350–2200): Warlords, witch-kings, barrow cults. Elves retreat to skyglass vales with surviving armories and the last master-smiths of aetherite; the craft dwindles and is finally lost.
- Remnant Age (ca. 2200–present): Feudal orders stabilize; merchant leagues rise; rationing and salvage of aetherite replace fabrication. Rumors grow of custodians’ return as liches and machine-ghosts.

Material Reality
- Only Slivers and a vanishing few Shards remain in circulation; lesser forms like Dust, or greater forms such as Prisms, or Hearts are unknown in the present age.

Known Catastrophes
- The Blackjaw Howl: a winter when mountain underways sang; every open flame blew green; thousands deafened or maddened.
- The Dimming: decade of weak stars; aether-users failed or cracked; Ember rites spread to hold communities together.

Recent History (last 20 years)
- Skyglass Skirmishes: elven wardens clash with prospectors near old lifts.
- Barrowmarch Consolidation: petty barons bend knee to a March-Lord for mutual defense.
- Shard Tithes: leagues and lords formalize taxes on aetherite to fund roads and levies.

GM Secrets
- The lich “Verran the Pale Archivist” bound his mind to Hollow cores after the Sundering. He seeks a First-Landing sub-reactor hidden beneath the starting town to bootstrap a new lattice and restart aetherite fabrication under his control.
- Goblin clans long kept fragments of custodian tech as totems; a captured Warden taught them crude Hollow song—now their shamans can pilot corrupted resonance.
