World Name: Calderos
Starting Landmass: The Horseshoe (campaign start)

Elevator Pitch
- Grim, grounded fantasy with ancient-scifi bones. Nearly three millennia ago, an Old Earth colony ship seeded life and infrastructure here, then collapsed. Feudal societies rose amid the ruins. Magic is rare and local, but the world’s ambient aether can be amplified by crystalline aetherite—a manufactured substance once fabricated by the colonists and later guarded as a secret by the elves. The elves have forgotten the technique, but their armories still hold stockpiles; as caches open and are fought over, old powers and old nightmares stir.

Tone & Themes
- Low, rising magic: mundane grit punctuated by rare, potent moments.
- War-weary lands: scarcity, grudges, and hard bargains.
- Secrets underfoot: buried facilities, sealed vaults, forgotten keeps.
- Choice over destiny: power has costs; victory has consequences.

- Calderos is an Old Earth colony (the “First Landing”). Terraformers fabricated aetherite and built a lattice to stabilize ambient aether. A lattice failure (the “Sundering”) shattered order and spoiled vast stores.
- “Magic” is disciplined aether manipulation. Aetherite acts as an amplifier and focus; corrupted or mis‑synthesized aetherite causes Hollowing—violent resonance that warps mind, body, and dead matter.
- After First Landing, elven masters monopolized aetherite manufacture; that craft is now lost. Elven armories and hidden depots still hold significant reserves.
- A lich-mind, Verran the Pale Archivist, once an uploaded custodian of colonial archives, survived in degraded substrates and now puppets necromancy via Hollow cores.

Everyday Assumptions
- Feudal structures dominate. Travel is risky; roads are patrolled by levy and mercenaries.
- Religion centers on hearth, memory, and oaths—not outer planes. Prayers bind communities and stabilize resonance (mechanical benefits in PF2E as morale/fortune effects).
- Aetherite exists now only as rare Slivers and near-mythic Shards. It is rationed, hoarded, smuggled, and fought over; most of it comes from old armories and salvage. Most people never handle it.

Player-Facing Summary
- You begin at the edge of a war on the Horseshoe: goblins surge from mountain warrens with strange, old magic. A lich’s hand moves behind them, seeking an elven sky-fortress and a buried engine beneath your town. Find aetherite, master it, choose who gets to shape what comes next.
