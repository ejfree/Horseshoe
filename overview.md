World Name: Calderos
Starting Landmass: The Horseshoe (campaign start)

Elevator Pitch
- Grim, grounded fantasy with ancient‑scifi bones. Calderos is a terraforming candidate from Earth’s Second Diaspora. A colony flotilla arrived ~3,300 years ago, surveyed for a decade, then initiated a millennium‑long terraforming program to warm a cold world at the edge of the habitable zone. The lattice later failed and the program collapsed. Feudal societies rose amid the ruins. Magic is rare and local, but the world’s ambient aether can still be amplified by crystalline aetherite—manufactured by the colonists and later guarded as a secret by the elves. The elves have forgotten the technique, but their armories still hold stockpiles.
  
Tone & Themes
- Low, rising magic: mundane grit punctuated by rare, potent moments.
- At first peaceful, feudal countries. But they will turn into war-weary lands with scarcity, grudges, and hard bargains.
- Choice over destiny: power has costs; victory has consequences.

- Terraforming Origin: Second Diaspora arrival ~3,300 years ago; 10‑year survey; ~1,000‑year active terraforming phase. Terraformers fabricated aetherite and built a lattice to stabilize ambient aether. A lattice failure (the “Sundering”) shattered order and spoiled vast stores.
- “Magic” is disciplined aether manipulation. Aetherite acts as an amplifier and focus; corrupted or mis‑synthesized aetherite causes Hollowing—violent resonance that warps mind, body, and dead matter.
- After First Landing, elven masters monopolized aetherite manufacture; that craft is now lost. Elven armories and hidden depots still hold significant reserves.
- A lich-mind, Verran the Pale Archivist, once an uploaded custodian of colonial archives, survived in degraded substrates and now puppets necromancy via Hollow cores.
 - Planet Geometry: Calderos orbits near the outer edge of its sun’s habitable zone; baseline climate skews cold. Warming interventions targeted currents, albedo, and atmospheric mixing. The equator tracks near the bottom edge of the Horseshoe map.
 - The Five Designers: five lead architects divided remit — four directed the major land divisions; the fifth built the floating resort/command city on the inner sea (“Nevegas”) as culture hub and logistics node. Nevegas later sank; its scrip and standards still echo in law and lore.

## The Five Designers (Second Diaspora)
- Tamsin Kade (“Stonewright”) — West Rim Hydrology
  - Domain: Blackjaw/Ironcradle west slopes; mountain hydrology; Grey Sluice cascade networks; under‑way stabilization.
  - Legacy quirks: overbuilt spillways sing in high wind; periodic “stone stair” exposures after floods.
- Yelena Arora (“Frostline”) — North Bend Cryosphere
  - Domain: glacier caps, High Fens peatwater balance, fog nets, snowpack modulation.
  - Legacy quirks: cold inversions that trap mists; spring thaws arrive in distinct pulses.
- Koji Nakata (“Greenband”) — East Inner Coast Agroclimate
  - Domain: Greenfold soils, shelterbelts, river‑plain routing, albedo tuning for fields and terraces.
  - Legacy quirks: windbreak forests that march in straight lines; self‑seeding cover crops.
- Malik Okoye (“Emberstream”) — South Rim Maritime Engine
  - Domain: coastal current shapers, the warm Ember Stream, cyclone buffers, harbor thermals.
  - Legacy quirks: off‑season warm fogs; regatta winds that appear on schedule.
- Mira Solace (“Dealer”) — Nevegas Floating City
  - Domain: inner‑sea floating city; culture/logistics hub; standards registry; escrow scrip economy; public interfaces.
  - Legacy quirks: Nevegas scrip norms persist (“put a shoe on it”); interface glyphs seeded into Bond rites.

Everyday Assumptions
- Feudal structures dominate. Travel is risky; roads are patrolled by levy and mercenaries.
- Religion centers on contracts and and oaths. Bro Handshake. There are no planes and no real dieties. Claim all magical power comes from the planet itself. Even the minor magics that several people have after training.  Rare members of the Old Church (Bondwright Synod) have aetherite. prividing significantly increased levels of magic. Rumors abound about special ops forces of the church. 
- Aetherite exists now only as rare Slivers and near-mythic Shards. It is rationed, hoarded, smuggled, and fought over; most of it comes from old armories and salvage. Most people never handle it.
 - Population: ~80,000,000 across the Horseshoe. See cities.md for ducal breakdown.

## Travel Ranges Summary
- Daily ranges (late‑medieval baselines):
  - Foot: 25–35 km/day on roads; 15–25 km cross‑country
  - Pack/ox‑cart: 15–25 km/day on good road or causeway
  - Rider: 40–60 km/day sustained; 80–100 km courier relays
  - Canal barge: 20–35 km/day upstream; 35–60 km/day downstream
  - River drift (non‑canalized): 30–50 km/day depending on flow and portages
  - Day‑sail (coast/lake): 40–60 km conservative; 60–100 km with fair wind and clear water
- Market and service radii:
  - Weekly market draw: 10–15 km radius (villages clustered 20–30 km apart)
  - Parish/ward services: 3–8 km radius (hamlets 8–15 km apart on corridors)
  - Garrison/granary hubs (towns): two–three days by cart → 40–70 km spacing
- Corridor effects (why spacing varies):
  - Levees/causeways/canals compress settlement strings and leave wider gaps off‑corridor
  - Mountain passes need close safety spacing (huts every 8–12 km; waystations 20–30 km)
  - Coasts form day‑sail chains of harbors; beacons 10–15 km along tricky segments
- Quick spacing cheat‑sheet:
  - Over land roads: hamlets 10–15 km; market villages 20–30 km; towns 40–60 km; cities 80–120 km
  - Rivers/canals: landings 8–12 km; villages 15–20 km; port towns 35–60 km; city ports 80–120 km; locks every 10–15 km where grade demands
  - Coastlines/lakes: fishing hamlets 6–10 km; harbor villages 15–25 km; harbor towns 35–60 km; major harbors 100–150 km
