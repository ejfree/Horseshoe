Overview
- Founder of the Virelle line in the Southfens; lit the marshes with lantern law and festival charters that turned flood and fete into fortune.

Appearance
- In mosaics: silver heron standard, lantern held high; cloak hem beaded with dew like stars.

Role
- Ancestor invoked at Lantern Parade openings and flood rites; his precedents shape mask guilds and lockhouse authority.

Legacy
- Codified festival charters as instruments of governance and trade.
- Established tide‑lock compacts that still govern river traffic.

Hooks
- A lantern said to bear his true flame reappears; is it relic or forgery?
- A lost lockhouse charter in his hand could break a modern monopoly.

Secrets (GM)
- May have drafted a “gray‑lane” clause that legitimized selective smuggling; a complete copy would be dynamite.
