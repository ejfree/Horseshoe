Overview
- Guild auditor with too many favors owed; sharp with numbers, slippery with lines.

Appearance
- Ink‑black gloves to keep ledgers clean; a half‑mask with an adding frame motif; polite cough before bad news.

Role
- Audits festival scrip, lockhouse tolls, and guild accounts; whispers to Anchor Court advocates.

Goals
- Reduce graft without collapsing the gray‑lane balancing act.
- Rebuild his reputation by exposing a major counterfeit ring.
- Keep his own marker holders from calling debts at once.

Relationships
- Matthieu: useful but watched; Pierro craves a return to favor.
- Rosamonde: respects her competence; fears her access.
- Seraphine: admires her tact; tries to stay indispensable.

Assets
- Access to guild books; informants in counting houses and back‑channels.

Hooks
- Offers inside maps to a scrip‑counterfeit ring in exchange for discreet help.
- Needs bodyguards after a lock tender he exposed vanishes.
- Seeks leverage on a broker who holds his largest debt marker.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a hidden ledger of bribes he refused—proof of integrity and a target list for enemies.
- Once laundered a rival’s money to keep a lockhouse open during floods; blackmail bait.
