Overview
- Mask‑maker and deft diplomat; reads faces and rooms, then crafts the persona the moment needs.

Appearance
- Fine lacquer dust on sleeves; collection of half‑masks on a ribbon; calm eyes that note exits and tides.

Role
- Heir apparent; represents Virelle at salons and anchor courts; curates guild exchange visits.

Goals
- Broker a tariff‑sharing pact that trades festival access for Evermead’s lighter inspections.
- Open a “white‑lantern” lane for insured, transparent high‑value cargo.
- Prove she can lead beyond masks—fieldwork with Lantern Watch.

Relationships
- Matthieu: respects her subtlety; fears excessive caution.
- Rosamonde: co‑creates allegories for policy in parade floats.
- Pierro: keeps him close enough to audit rivals, not allies.

Assets
- Guild envoys in three cities; mask atelier with skilled artisans.

Hooks
- Needs protection for a parley aboard a storm brigantine during festival week.
- Seeks a missing shipment of rare resins needed for treaty gifts.
- Hires observers to uncover who leaks anchor‑court strategies to rivals.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a second ledger of favors owed to her personally—dangerous if discovered.
- Crafted a mask that mimics a noble’s features; its misuse could ignite scandal.
