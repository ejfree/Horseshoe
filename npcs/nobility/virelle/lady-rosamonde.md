Overview
- Famed festival choreographer; turns city blocks into stages and guild rivalries into rehearsed spectacles.

Appearance
- Silver‑threaded gown dusted with glitter; chalk on fingertips from mapping parade steps; a conductor’s baton tucked like a hairpin.

Role
- Consort to Duke Matthieu; designs Lantern Parade routes, assigns troupe licenses, and aligns ceremonies with policy announcements.

Goals
- Prevent stampedes and sabotage by redesigning crowd flows and signal codes.
- Export Miregate’s festival model to friendly cities for soft‑power gains.
- Elevate safety standards without killing the magic.

Relationships
- Matthieu: strategic partnership; she sets the rhythm, he sells the encore.
- Seraphine: protege in masks and meanings; gently pushes her to reveal more.
- Pierro: tolerates his audits when they improve safety; blocks him when they don’t.

Assets
- Troupe captains, fireworks guild, costume houses, and route marshals.
- Maps of rooftops and balconies used for routing and security.

Hooks
- Hires troubleshooters after a saboteur salts fireworks with wet powder.
- Needs recovery of a stolen cue‑book that reveals emergency routes.
- Seeks testers for a lantern‑signal system to clear bridges in emergencies.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a private ledger of “borrowed” gray‑lane favors used to stage last‑minute rescues.
- Once redirected a parade to shield a Floodward ritual; only three people know.
