Overview
- Charming, calculating patron of guilds; turns festivals into policy and tariffs into leverage. Keeps Miregate’s canals bright and profitable.

Appearance
- Azure coat with lantern‑gold trim; mask cord at wrist; smile that suggests three backup plans.

Role
- Duke of House Virelle; presides over the Hall of Masks (guild conclave), Tide‑Lock Consortium, and festival charters.

Goals
- Lock in cross‑duchy festival routes that double as trade corridors.
- Keep gray‑lane smuggling “sanctioned” enough to steer coin, not chaos.
- Outmaneuver Brinemark at anchor courts without open conflict.

Relationships
- Lady Rosamonde (consort): trusts her to choreograph festivals that sell policy.
- Lady Seraphine (heir): values her diplomacy; worries she masks too much.
- Cousin Pierro: useful auditor with too many favors and enemies.

Assets
- Lantern Watch operatives, Canal Guard loyalties, and guild proxies.
- Control of key tide‑lock schedules and festival licenses.

Hooks
- Seeks discreet agents to trace counterfeit festival scrip flooding markets.
- Offers patronage to retrieve a stolen master mask before the Lantern Parade.
- Needs proof that Brinemark factors bribed a lock tender to stall convoys.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a black‑book ledger of gray‑lane “tolerances” that could topple him if leaked.
- Quietly funds Floodward rites with off‑ledger coin to avoid public dependency on the Splinter.
