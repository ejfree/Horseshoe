# Duchy of the High Marches — House Ironholt of Stonecross

## Overview
The third line took the rocky ridges and deep forests. House Ironholt rules stoic timber camps, smoky forges, and mountain roads. They are plain‑spoken, oath‑true, and slow to anger — until they are not.

## Seat and Holdings
- Seat: `Stonecross` — a fortress‑town at the meeting of two ridgelines and the Iron Road.
- Core Holdings: Blackpine Tracts, Redspan Mines, Granite Steps, and the High Sawmills.
- Notables: The Anvil Stair, Oath‑Hall of Clans, and the Lantern Pass Watchfires.

## Heraldry
- Sigil: A black pickaxe crossed with a fir bough on granite gray.
- Colors: Slate gray, pine green, and iron black.
- Motto: “By Stone and Sap.”

## Line and Succession
- Founder: Prince Garrick Ironholt, the Third.
- Current Ruler: Duke Torvin Ironholt (46), taciturn, respected by the highland clans.
- Consort: Lady Brinna of Lantern Pass (44), famed hunter and mediator.
- Heir Apparent: Bram Ironholt (19), strong, studious, seeks to modernize mines safely.
- Notable Kin: Uncle Heddan, master of the Iron Road caravans.

## Court and Culture
- Oath‑rings mark major accords; perjury is social death.
- Songs of labor, long firelit councils, and strong tea laced with pine resin.
- Practical faith: ancestors honored at pass shrines.

## Economy and Assets
- Iron, copper, and rare woods; expert sawyers and smiths.
- Joint ventures with Evermead for ploughshares and wagons; sells braces for Miregate’s floodgates.
- Strategic asset: The Iron Road — a maintained mountain route with clan toll rights.

## Aetherite Holdings
- Splinter: Lantern Pass Splinter (Confirmed). Employed to bind avalanche wards and temper oath‑rings during high‑risk accords; housed in the Oath‑Hall of Clans with clan‑ring rotation.
- Shard: None confirmed. Miners whisper of an “Anvil Heart,” but assays marked it slag fused with Hollow residue.

## Military
- Pike‑and‑crossbow companies; sappers skilled in terrain control.
- Pass Wardens: small elite units who can vanish in fog and timber.
- Timber‑ram engines for sieges and avalanche‑trigger defenses.

## Diplomacy and Tensions
- Cordial with Evermead; wary respect for Virelle; often exasperated by Brinemark’s privateers.
- Feudlets with certain Larksong preserves over logging boundaries.

## Reunification Stance
- Leans favorable if it guarantees road security and fair timber rights. Prefers a compacted crown bound by oaths.

## Adventure Hooks
- The Hollow Pick: a mine that “sings” and drives crews mad needs cleansing or closure.
- Firline War: a border logging camp sparks a skirmish with Larksong wardens.
- The Broken Oath: an ancient oath‑ring cracks; an old pact with a pass‑spirit must be renewed.
