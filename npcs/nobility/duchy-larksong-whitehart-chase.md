# Duchy of Whitehart Chase — House Larksong of Auravale

## Overview
The fourth line received sweeping reserves: royal hunts, sacred groves, hot springs, and summer estates. House Larksong rules by invitation and influence, weaving soft power through hospitality, art, and impeccable taste.

## Seat and Holdings
- Seat: `Auravale` — a lakeside retreat city of colonnades, bathhouses, theatres, and discreet ministries.
- Core Holdings: Whitehart Preserve, Sunspire Springs, Poet’s Wood, and the Lake Aurum Regatta.
- Notables: The Stagcourt Lodge, the Conservatory of Strings, and the Treaty Gardens.

## Heraldry
- Sigil: A white stag leaping above a golden lyre on violet.
- Colors: Violet, ivory, and sun‑gold.
- Motto: “Grace Guides the Arrow.”

## Line and Succession
- Founder: Prince Corvel Larksong, the Fourth.
- Current Ruler: Duchess Ysabet Larksong (41), poised, razor‑keen in salons and summits.
- Consort: Lord Thalen (43), master of ceremonies and logistics of luxury.
- Heir Apparent: Lady Lyra Larksong (20), gifted musician and keen archer.
- Notable Kin: Cousin Maelle, keeper of guest‑lists and grudges.

## Court and Culture
- Invitation‑only salons where policy is set over poetry.
- Sacred hunt rites shared with clerics of the Old Church.
- Spa diplomacy: rival envoys negotiate in steam and song.

## Economy and Assets
- Licenses for preserves, hunts, regattas, and spa resorts; couture, vintages, and fine instruments.
- Strategic asset: The Treaty Gardens — neutral ground sanctified by all five ducal lines.

## Aetherite Holdings
- Splinter: Treaty Garden Splinter (Confirmed). Used sparingly during solemn treaties and ceremonial coronations‑that‑aren’t; kept beneath the Conservatory of Strings behind three song‑locks.
- Shard: Rumored “Silent Lyre Shard.” Court murmurs insist the Conservatory’s master lyre hides a true shard core. If so, it would be the realm’s only noble‑held shard — and Larksong denies it sweetly.

## Military
- Wardens of Whitehart: elite rangers who guard preserves, expert trackers and archers.
- Auravale Horse: swift light cavalry for escort and interdiction.
- Arrow‑choirs: archer units drilled to fire to music for signal precision.

## Diplomacy and Tensions
- Mediates between Evermead and Virelle; quietly resents Ironholt logging near sacred groves.
- Flirts with Brinemark captains to secure private regatta escorts.

## Reunification Stance
- Publicly favors harmony without crowns; privately collects royal relics and drafts ceremonial frameworks in case a crown returns.

## Adventure Hooks
- The Silent Lyre: a relic lyre that once crowned kings refuses to sound.
- Stag in Winter: a white stag flees a burning grove; who lit the fire and why?
- Masks and Vows: a salon duel of wits hides a marriage pact with continent‑wide stakes.
