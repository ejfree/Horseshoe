Overview
- Logistics savant; turns ledgers into loaves. Designs barge schedules, mill rotations, and winter stores that hold the duchy steady.

Appearance
- Long coat with river‑blue piping; abacus ring on thumb; eyes that count without seeming to.

Role
- Consort to Elowen; master of river wardens’ timetables, mill quotas, and convoy provisioning.

Goals
- Reduce spoilage by revamping silo airflow and sack standards.
- Synchronize Yarrow River barge locks to cut transit delays by a tenth.
- Train wardens to spot graft patterns in tollhouses.

Relationships
- Elowen: mutual trust; healthy debates over risk tolerance.
- Corin: tutors him in practical costs beneath ideals.
- Ironholt: coordinates iron‑for‑ploughshares shipments; respects their straight weights.

Assets
- River Warden schedules, lockmaster loyalties, and warehouse audits.
- Favor with Anchor Court factors for convoy supply contracts.

Hooks
- Needs investigators after millstones are sabotaged before the Harvest Moot.
- Seeks deniable couriers to bypass a Virelle embargo with lawful paperwork.
- Offers pay to test a new lock sequence on a night run with dummy cargo.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a shadow capacity ledger to cushion lean years; rivals would call it market rigging.
- Suspects a tollhouse ring is swapping certified weights; needs proof to purge.
