Overview
- Archivist aunt with a map of the law in her head; rumored to know the Writ’s missing clauses or where to find them.

Appearance
- Gray streak at the temple; spectacles on a chain; ink‑black gowns with hidden pockets of tabs and slips.

Role
- Oversees sections of the Annalery; consults for the Ledger Court on precedent and standards.

Goals
- Recover and reconcile lost leaves of the Writ of Partition.
- Cross‑index provincial weights to expose quiet tariff theft.
- Train a cohort of clerks immune to fashion and faction.

Relationships
- Elowen: guarded affection; shields her from politicized “history.”
- Corin: encourages curiosity; insists on primary sources.
- Bondwright Signers: professional respect; occasional turf spats over custody.

Assets
- Keys to sealed stacks; favors from old librarians and sealwrights.
- A private concordance of variant Writ copies.

Hooks
- Hires discreet recoverers for a ledger page held by spectral auditors.
- Needs escorts into a closed granary wing rumored to be haunted by “bean‑counters.”
- Seeks a neutral copyist to duplicate a fragile charter under watch.

Secrets (GM)
- Knows a clause that, if public, would force a tariff rollback and humiliate a rival duchy.
- Keeps a quiet pact with a Signer to mirror sensitive leaves beyond Evermead’s grasp.
