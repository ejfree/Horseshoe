Overview
- Meticulous, reform‑minded duchess of Greenwold; steward of Highspire’s granaries and standards. Prefers measured compacts to flashy decrees.

Appearance
- Neat braids, ink at the fingertips, precise diction. Wears a simple wheat‑sheaf torque and carries a seal case for weights writs.

Role
- Presides over the Harvest Moot, the Hall of Weights, and the Ledger Court. Balances plenty with price to keep peace without waste.

Goals
- Standardize grain measures and mill tolls across duchies via reciprocal Bonds.
- Expand Highspire Granary Bonds while curbing speculation and famine panics.
- Study models for a constitutional crown that preserves ducal guarantees.

Relationships
- Lord Harwick (consort): relies on his logistics to turn policy into wagons and barges.
- Lord Corin (heir): encourages idealism; insists on footnotes and costs.
- Aunt Merevi: trusts her to hunt lost clauses; protects her from court politics.

Assets
- Hall of Weights authority, granary reserves, and annalists’ goodwill.
- Quiet ties to Bondwright clerks who mirror ledgers and audit mills.

Hooks
- Seeks discreet verifiers for a cross‑duchy measure trial at the Harvest Moot.
- Hires protection after arson attempts at two granaries ahead of tariff talks.
- Commissions a retrieval of a mislaid ledger leaf that could check Virelle’s fees.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps private correspondence with two other dukes sketching a charter—explosive if leaked prematurely.
- Knows the Granary Measure‑Splinter can calm crowds; fears becoming dependent on it.
