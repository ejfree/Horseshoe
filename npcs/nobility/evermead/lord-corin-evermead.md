Overview
- Idealistic heir, 17; studies old royal charters and dreams of just compacts. Earnest, curious, sometimes naïve about costs.

Appearance
- Scholarly, ink‑smudged cuffs, carries a satchel of copied clauses. A plain coronet pin and a sincere smile.

Role
- Pages through annals, sits in on Ledger Court, and tours mills and markets to see law meet labor.

Goals
- Draft a model “Rights of Commons” to bind grain policy to fairness.
- Build student exchanges with Bondwright scribes to spread standards.
- Prove he can negotiate without Elowen or Harwick holding his hand.

Relationships
- Elowen: admires her steadiness; wants to earn her trust.
- Harwick: grudging respect for logistics; learns that ideals need timetables.
- Aunt Merevi: co‑conspirator in archive hunts; she keeps him grounded.

Assets
- Access to the Annalery stacks and Ledger Court galleries.
- Friendships with young clerks across duchies via letters.

Hooks
- Seeks help locating a missing folio rumored to hold a Writ clause.
- Needs protection for a debate trip to Miregate on tariffs.
- Commissions interviews with millers and bargers to ground a policy draft.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a hidden notebook weighing restoration of a crown—dangerous if stolen.
- Once signed a private pledge with peers; could be exploited as a proto‑faction.
