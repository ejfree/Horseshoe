# The Pentarch Duchies of Horseshoe

A century ago, King Marrec the Even‑Handed ended the single crown of Horseshoe. Seeking to avoid a succession war among his five beloved sons, he invoked an ancient Writ of Partition — a rarely used companion to primogeniture — that confirmed the eldest’s precedence while granting hereditary ducal sovereignties to each son over distinct regions. The kingdom dissolved into five duchies, together called the Pentarch Duchies.

Today, two to four generations later, the ducal lines remain strong. Some factions still whisper for a single ruler to reunite Horseshoe; others treasure the freedoms, fortunes, and local identities the Pentarchy created.

## Quick Map of Power
- Eldest’s Line — Greenwold and the Old Capital (breadbasket, bureaucracy, coin): House Evermead of Highspire.
- Second’s Line — Southfens Canal City‑State (festivals, guilds, intrigue): House Virelle of Miregate.
- Third’s Line — High Marches Timber and Ore (iron, lumber, stoic clans): House Ironholt of Stonecross.
- Fourth’s Line — Whitehart Chase (royal preserves and resorts): House Larksong of Auravale.
- Fifth’s Line — Lowcester Trade Marches (ports, privateers, rough coin): House Brinemark of Saltmarch.

## The Partition (summary)
- Year 0 AP (After Partition): Writ read in the Old Capital; the Eldest receives crownlands and the city; his brothers receive hereditary duchies named for their regions and swear mutual non‑aggression.
- Year 12 AP: First Pentarch Concord — formalizes shared tariffs, river rights, and mutual defense clauses.
- Year 63 AP: Canal Riots in Miregate; guild charters revised; smuggling spikes along Lowcester.
- Year 94 AP: High Marches Iron Road completed; Greenwold granary reforms exported to Stonecross.
- Year 100 AP (current): Murmurs of reunification resurface amid border feuds and festival diplomacy.

## Reunification Factions (recurring)
- Crown Loyalists: Clerics, old courtiers, and certain knights who want a single sovereign again.
- Free Duchies Compact: A cross‑ducal bloc arguing the Pentarchy is the realm’s strength.
- Mercantile League: Canal and coast magnates, pro‑trade, skeptical of crowns but pro‑stability.
- Old Church of the Horseshoe (Bondwright Synod): Civic oath order that witnesses compacts, keeps annals, runs neutral odds and escrow, and mediates feuds.
