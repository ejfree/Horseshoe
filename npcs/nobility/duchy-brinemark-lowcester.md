# Duchy of Lowcester — House Brinemark of Saltmarch

## Overview
The fifth line received the storm‑gnawed lowlands and their bustling ports — the least prized at the Partition, now a rough‑and‑ready engine of trade. House Brinemark thrives in hard weather and harder bargains.

## Seat and Holdings
- Seat: `Saltmarch` — a breakers‑guarded harbor town of shipyards, ropewalks, and sea‑shrines.
- Core Holdings: Lowcester Marches, Stormbar Breakers, Driftport Chain, and the Quays of Nine Flags.
- Notables: The Black Gull Docks, the Anchor Court (maritime law), and the Wrecklight.

## Heraldry
- Sigil: A black gull clutching an anchor over a storm‑gray wave.
- Colors: Charcoal, sea‑green, and salt‑white.
- Motto: “In Rough Seas, Profit.”

## Line and Succession
- Founder: Prince Niall Brinemark, the Fifth.
- Current Ruler: Duke Joss Brinemark (35), bold, popular with sailors, keeps a dagger smile.
- Consort: Captain Rhea Stormbar (37), privateer turned shipwright.
- Heir Apparent: Kane Brinemark (14), apprenticed to the ropewalk, keen eye for knots and numbers.
- Notable Kin: Aunt Vessa, admiral of the Letter‑of‑Marque Fleet.

## Court and Culture
- Tide‑tables and tavern councils; oaths sworn on salt and storm.
- Ship‑launch festivals double as recruitment and debt jubilee events.
- Sea‑shrines to wind and wave revered by fisherfolk and captains alike.

## Economy and Assets
- Shipbuilding, salt, fish, and exchange of “brown goods” the other duchies pretend not to see.
- Licensed privateering during declared conflicts; salvage rights in the breakers.
- Strategic asset: The Nine‑Flags Convoys — mixed‑duchy merchant fleets under Brinemark escort.

## Aetherite Holdings
- Splinter: Wrecklight Splinter (Confirmed). A sea‑blessed fragment mounted only in dire fog to pierce false beacons and guide convoys; housed at the Wrecklight Shrine with salt‑oath wards.
- Shard: Sailor’s lore claims the “Wrecklight Heart” is a shard. Lantern Collegium tests suggest a bright splinter cluster and polished glass.

## Military
- The Brine Guard: marines who fight on deck and dock alike.
- Letter‑of‑Marque Fleet: fast sloops and brigs with captains loyal to coin and kin.
- Breaker Batteries: coastal guns and signal fires.

## Diplomacy and Tensions
- Tests borders with Virelle’s gray lanes; undercuts Evermead tolls by sea.
- Sells seasoned ship‑timbers from Ironholt; rents regatta escorts to Larksong nobles.

## Reunification Stance
- Publicly scoffs; privately open if a crown brings letters of marque and coastal autonomy.

## Adventure Hooks
- The Wrecklight: a false light lures ships to doom — who profits?
- Anchor Court Gambit: a maritime trial pits Brinemark law against Virelle guild charters.
- The Ninth Flag: a missing convoy pennant hints at treachery in the escort ranks.
