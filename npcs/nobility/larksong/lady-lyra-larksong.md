Overview
- Gifted musician and keen archer; heir who blends art with duty. Believes beauty can bind peace as surely as law.

Appearance
- Dark curls, callused fingertips, archer’s posture; favors green‑gold gowns with a simple lyre pin.

Role
- Performs at salons and leads ceremonial arrow‑choirs; trains with Wardens of Whitehart.

Goals
- Compose a “Treaty Mass” whose movements time salutes, signals, and signatures.
- Prove field competence by leading a warden patrol without scandal.
- Sponsor apprentices from outside duchies to study at the Conservatory.

Relationships
- Ysabet: seeks her approval; resists being only an ornament.
- Thalen: mentor in logistics; learns that art needs run‑of‑show.
- Maelle: wary of being turned into a pawn on guest lists.

Assets
- Conservatory access, arrow‑choir loyalty, and rapport with wardens.

Hooks
- Requests guards for a night hunt after threats target a white stag rite.
- Needs help retrieving a stolen draft score rumored to reveal secret accords.
- Seeks sparring partners to test new signal‑music under pressure.

Secrets (GM)
- Hid a royal‑chord motif in her composition that could open song‑locks.
- Keeps a private archery target etched with a rival duchy’s sigil; she aims to outshoot politics, not start war—but optics are poor.
