Overview
- Keeper of guest‑lists and grudges; remembers every slight and kindness. Smiles like a knife in velvet.

Appearance
- Perfect penmanship, perfume of citrus and cedar; carries a folio of place cards and a hidden tally of offenses.

Role
- Sets seating, invites, and snubs; whispers that become policy.

Goals
- Protect Larksong prestige by rewarding loyalty and punishing rudeness with precision.
- Turn rival salons into satellite stages for Ysabet’s agenda.
- Bury a brewing scandal before it stains the Treaty Gardens.

Relationships
- Ysabet: devoted instrument; craves trust beyond errands.
- Thalen: professional foil; he rounds her sharp edges.
- Lyra: fondness tempered by jealousy of public affection.

Assets
- Social maps of alliances; dirt files; favors owed by artists and courtiers.

Hooks
- Hires deniable agents to retrieve a blackmail letter before a masque.
- Needs proof that a rival faked sacred‑grove permits to embarrass Larksong.
- Offers introductions if PCs make a pariah “disappear” from guest lists (nonlethal preferred).

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a duplicate guest book that can ruin a dozen careers if opened.
- Once sold a seating plan to a foreign envoy; regrets it, fears exposure.
