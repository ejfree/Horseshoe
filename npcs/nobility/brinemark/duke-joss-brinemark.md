Overview
- Bold, harbor‑popular duke with a dagger smile; cuts deals in storm and calm. Keeps shipyards busy and convoys profitable.

Appearance
- Sea‑green coat with tar‑black cuffs, weathered hands, easy grin that never reaches both eyes. Carries a court token shaped like an anchor.

Role
- Ruler of House Brinemark from Saltmarch; oversees Anchor Court, Nine‑Flags convoys, and letters of marque.

Goals
- Secure season‑long convoy contracts that undercut Evermead tolls.
- Keep the Letter‑of‑Marque captains loyal to coin and crown, not rivals.
- Expand coastal batteries without provoking a duchy arms race.

Relationships
- Captain Rhea Stormbar (consort): trusts her yardcraft and judgment more than most.
- Aunt Vessa: values results; wary of her appetite for prize claims.
- Ironholt: buys their timbers; respects their straight dealing.

Assets
- Brine Guard marines, Anchor Court favor, and signal‑tower network along the breakers.
- Standing with major guilds for rope, pitch, and sail.

Hooks
- Seeks discreet agents to expose a false‑light ring near the Wrecklight.
- Offers a cut of prize for tracing a vanishing “ninth flag” within convoy escorts.
- Needs neutral witnesses for a test case pitting Anchor Court against Virelle charters.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a private salvage consortium skirting the edge of his own laws; collapses it if discovered.
- Holds letters proving a rival duchy funded lighthouse outages to void insurance.
