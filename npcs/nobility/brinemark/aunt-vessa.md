Role
- Commands privateer captains under Brinemark letters; coordinates convoy screens and hunts raiders.

Goals

- Break a rival consortium skimming convoy fees.
- Secure better batteries and signal chains along the breakers.

Relationships
- Joss: nephew and duke; friction over court compromises.
- Rhea: mutual respect; disputes yard delays versus fleet needs.
- Evermead and Virelle: professional rivals; courts defectors.

Assets
- Fast sloops and seasoned crews; informants in taverns and broker houses.
- Anchor Court advocates who owe her favors from clean captures.

Hooks
