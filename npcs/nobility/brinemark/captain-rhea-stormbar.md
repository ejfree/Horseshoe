Overview
- Privateer turned shipwright; designs fast, forgiving hulls and runs the Saltmarch yards with a captain’s pragmatism.

Appearance
- Sun‑browned, cropped hair, sleeves rolled; chalk and tar on her fingers. Keeps a brass caliper and a weather‑cracked logbook.

Role
- Consort to Duke Joss; master of drydocks and ropewalk contracts; mentors captains retiring to the yards.

Goals
- Standardize yard patterns for quicker refits between convoy seasons.
- Source better pitch and seasoned timbers to cut maintenance at sea.
- Transition gray‑area privateers into legitimate escort service without losing edge.

Relationships
- Joss: equals in private; in public, she plays the shipwright.
- Aunt Vessa: respects her seamanship, disputes her prize‑taking politics.
- Ironholt/Stormbar: lines to timber and breaker crews.

Assets
- Design notebooks for shallow‑draft brigs; trusted foremen across three yards.
- Quiet ties to Anchor Court advocates for maritime injury Bonds.

Hooks
- Commissions field tests of a new reefing rig in heavy weather.
- Needs investigators after saboteurs salt fresh timbers in the yard.
- Offers work escorting a prototype hull to Driftport under cloak of routine convoy.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a hidden cove workshop where she trials hull changes without guild oversight.
- Her last privateer prize left an unresolved hostage claim; it could explode politically.
