Overview
- Founder of the Brinemark line in Lowcester; turned storm‑gnawed coasts into a trade engine with letters of marque and convoy law.

Appearance
- In tapestries: black gull pennon snapping, sea‑cloak, jaw set against spray.

Role
- Ancestor revered at sea‑shrines and Anchor Court; his precedents still shape convoy rules and prize law.

Legacy
- Established the Anchor Court and Nine‑Flags convoy compacts.
- Codified letters of marque to channel predation into policy.

Hooks
- A lost royal charter bearing his seal resurfaces; courts and captains collide.
- A rumored “Wrecklight Heart” logbook in his hand could settle a generations‑long claim.

Secrets (GM)
- May have struck a secret compact with a coastal enclave for safe harbors; traces lie in submerged vaults beneath the breakers.
