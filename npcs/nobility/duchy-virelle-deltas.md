# Duchy of the Southern Deltas — House Virelle of Miregate

## Overview
The second line chose the city life among warm marshes and winding canals. House Virelle rules a Venice‑meets‑New‑Orleans metropolis of lanternlit festivals, masked guilds, levees, and music. Wealth flows through celebrations, tariffs, and risk.

## Seat and Holdings
- Seat: `Miregate` — a delta city on stilts and stones, with grand plazas and narrow waterways.
- Core Holdings: Southmarsh Canals, Festival Quarters, Tide‑Locks, and the Night Orchid Market.
- Notables: The Lantern Parade, The Hall of Masks (guild conclave), and the Floodward Tower.

## Heraldry
- Sigil: A silver heron bearing a lantern above blue waves and reeds.
- Colors: Azure and silver, with lantern‑gold.
- Motto: “Where the Lantern Leads.”

## Line and Succession
- Founder: Prince Lucent Virelle, the Second.
- Current Ruler: Duke Matthieu Virelle (52), charming, calculating patron of guilds.
- Consort: Lady Rosamonde (46), a famed festival choreographer.
- Heir Apparent: Lady Seraphine Virelle (24), mask‑maker and deft diplomat.
- Notable Kin: Cousin Pierro, guild auditor with too many favors owed.

## Court and Culture
- Masks, music, and mercantile wit; every deal is a performance.
- Festivals double as political summits; secrets are traded like spices.
- Floodward priests bless levees; storm‑chanters hired during cyclone season.

## Economy and Assets
- Tariff control at river mouths, spice and silk import, festival licenses, exotic crafts.
- Shadow economy: sanctioned smuggling in “gray lanes” to keep coin moving.
- Strategic asset: Tide‑Lock Consortium that can stall or surge river traffic.

## Aetherite Holdings
- Splinter: Floodward Splinter (Confirmed). Brought to the Floodward Tower during cyclone season to fortify levees and calm waters for evacuations; guarded by masked guild marshals and Church witnesses.
- Shard: None confirmed. A jeweled festival lamp touted as a “river shard” is a famed decoy built from inert lattice.

## Military
- Canal Guard: spear‑and‑gondola troops expert in urban amphibious combat.
- The Lantern Watch: elite night operatives with signal codes and quiet blades.
- Storm Brigantines: shallow‑draft ships that can outrun coastal squalls.

## Diplomacy and Tensions
- Longstanding rivalry with Brinemark over privateering boundaries and port fees.
- Bristles at Evermead inspections; accuses Highspire of “weighing down joy with ledgers.”
- Courted by Larksong patrons; buys Ironholt iron to armor its floodgates.

## Reunification Stance
- Opposed unless a charter guarantees guild freedoms and festival rights. Would rather lead a mercantile compact than bow to a crown.

## Adventure Hooks
- Mask of the Flood King: a legendary festival mask goes missing days before the Lantern Parade.
- Gray Lane Ledger: a smuggling route map surfaces; three guilds and a priesthood want it first.
- The Ninth Bell: flood sirens ring in a clear sky — sabotage or omen?
