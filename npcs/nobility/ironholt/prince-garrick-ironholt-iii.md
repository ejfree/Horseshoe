Overview
- Founder of House Ironholt’s High Marches line; carved the Iron Road and bound the first pass accords after the Pentarch division.

Appearance
- In murals: cloak pinned with a pick and fir bough; scar across the brow; steady gaze.

Role
- Ancestor revered at pass shrines; invoked when oaths bind stone to sap.

Legacy
- Set the expectation that Ironholt rulers work beside their people and keep roads safe before courts grandstand.
- Established the Oath‑Hall custom of ring‑binding accords witnessed by clans and wardens.

Hooks
- A cracked oath‑ring attributed to Garrick surfaces; priests and clans dispute its authenticity.
- A lost survey of the original Iron Road is rumored to map a safer, forgotten grade.

Secrets (GM)
- His final winter march likely rerouted an ancient terraformer sluice; evidence lies under a landslide‑drowned spur road.
