Overview
- Taciturn, oath‑true ruler of the High Marches; respected by highland clans and camp foremen alike. Keeps the Iron Road clear and the pass courts fair.

Appearance
- Broad‑shouldered, weathered hands, close‑cropped iron hair; travel‑stained cloak over plain, well‑made mail. Speaks slowly; listens longer.

Role
- Duke of House Ironholt; holds Stonecross, the Anvil Stair, and the Iron Road toll rights. Presides over the Oath‑Hall of Clans and pass accords.

Goals
- Keep winter stores high and roads open without bleeding the clans.
- Modernize mines cautiously to reduce collapses and gas deaths.
- Hold neutrality in ducal squabbles while defending logging claims.

Relationships
- Lady Brinna (consort): trusted envoy and hunter; his sharpest counsel.
- Bram (heir): proud of his diligence; wary of youthful haste.
- Uncle Heddan: relies on his caravan sense; watches his appetite for risk.

Assets
- Pass Wardens cadre, veteran sappers, and clan levy oaths.
- Letters of standing with Evermead for ploughshare iron.
- Oath‑rings and avalanche ward protocols at Lantern Pass.

Hooks
- Requests neutral witnesses for a border timber parley with Larksong wardens.
- Seeks experts to assess a “singing” drift without spooking miners.
- Offers convoy pay to clear saboteurs off a perilous Iron Road span.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a sealed ledger of unpaid blood‑debts between clans; uses it to time reconciliations, not revenge.
- Suspects a steward sold drift maps to outside speculators; seeks proof quietly.
