Overview

Goals
- Keep convoys on time through thaw and bandit season.
- Standardize wagon brakes and signal codes across all teams.
- Expand rest‑stops with forges and farriers to cut breakdowns.

Relationships
- Torvin: loyal; worries the duke underestimates saboteurs.
- Brinna: defers to her on clan politics; she defers to him on roads.
- Bram: humors ideas, demands field trials before rollout.

Assets
- Network of roadwardens, wayhouse keepers, and farriers.
- Spare axles, chain kits, and a hidden cache of stamped arbalests for convoy defense.

Hooks

Secrets (GM)
