Overview
- Heir apparent; strong, studious, determined to modernize mines and mills safely. Looks for practical innovations that keep crews alive.

Appearance
- Broad‑cheeked youth with soot‑lined fingernails; keeps notes in a leather book. Wears a simple torque and a miner’s lamp on his belt.

Role
- Apprentice to the dukedom’s burdens; surveys drifts, audits props, and interviews crews.

Goals
- Trial safer venting and gas‑test protocols across three flagship drifts.
- Import improved hoist brakes and sawyard guards from Evermead smiths.
- Prove that safety pays in coin and lives to skeptical foremen.

Relationships
- Torvin: seeks approval; fears seeming naïve.
- Brinna: mentor in diplomacy; she tempers his impatience.
- Uncle Heddan: indulges Bram’s ideas if the math works; supplies caravans.

Assets
- Sketches and models of hoist and brake mechanisms; letters to Evermead artisans.
- Rapport with younger cutters and miners who trust he listens.

Hooks
- Hires testers to stress a new brake on a dangerous grade.
- Needs neutral witnesses for a pilot safety Bond with skeptical pit bosses.
- Seeks samples from a “green‑spark” seam to test fume risk.

Secrets (GM)
- Quietly funds widows’ stipends from his allowance; no one is to know.
- Keeps a failed design that nearly cost a life as a reminder to retest everything.
