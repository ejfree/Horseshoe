# Note on the Five Founders and Names

For quick reference when weaving the ducal genealogies into play:

- The Wise King: King Marrec the Even‑Handed (the last crowned monarch of Horseshoe).
- Eldest Son (Greenwold): Prince Aldren Evermead — Old Capital and crownlands.
- Second Son (Southfens): Prince Lucent Virelle — the canal city‑state.
- Third Son (High Marches): Prince Garrick Ironholt — timber and mines.
- Fourth Son (Whitehart Chase): Prince Corvel Larksong — preserves and resorts.
- Fifth Son (Lowcester): Prince Niall Brinemark — stormy trade coast.

Feel free to rename King Marrec to your preferred $name; the materials will still fit.
