# Duchy of Greenwold — House Evermead of Highspire

## Overview
The eldest line of King Marrec’s sons holds the lush heartlands and the Old Capital. House Evermead presides over the breadbasket that feeds the entire Horseshoe and the bureaucracy that once served a single crown. Their rule is orderly, pragmatic, and quietly ambitious.

## Seat and Holdings
- Seat: `Highspire` — the former royal capital, now a ducal city of granaries, counting houses, and archives.
- Core Holdings: Greenbarrow Plains, River Yarrow bends, Highspire Crown District, the Royal Granaries (now Ducal).
- Notables: The Ledger Court (civil clerks), the Hall of Weights (standards), and the Old Crown Gate.

## Heraldry
- Sigil: A golden wheat‑sheaf beneath an open crown on green.
- Colors: Harvest gold and field green.
- Motto: “We Feed the Realm.”

## Line and Succession
- Founder: Prince Aldren Evermead, the Eldest.
- Current Ruler: Duchess Elowen Evermead (38), meticulous and reform‑minded.
- Consort: Lord Harwick of Yarrowbridge (41), a logistics savant.
- Heir Apparent: Lord Corin Evermead (17), idealistic, studies old royal charters.
- Notable Kin: Aunt Merevi (archivist who knows the Writ’s missing clauses).

## Court and Culture
- Values order, accurate ledgers, and benevolent provisioning.
- Hosts the Harvest Moot where tariffs and grain quotas are negotiated.
- Bondwright clerks of the Old Church keep the Pentarch annals here.

## Economy and Assets
- Breadbasket agriculture (wheat, barley, pulses), millworks, and river barge fleets.
- Coin‑mints licensed to weigh and assay across duchies.
- Strategic asset: The Highspire Granary Bonds — promises of future grain redeemable at fair rate.

## Aetherite Holdings
- Splinter: Granary Measure‑Splinter (Confirmed). Used to stabilize granary rites, quell bread riots, and seal harvest compacts; kept in the Hall of Weights. Issued under Duchess Elowen’s writ with Church countersign.
- Shard: None confirmed. Court tales claim the Old Crown Gate keystone “sleeps like a shard,” but scholars call it ornamented latticework.

## Military
- The Banner of Sheaves: heavy infantry levees with tower shields.
- Yarrow River Wardens: light riverine troops who escort barges.
- Stores enough grain to outlast most sieges; uses supply power as leverage.

## Diplomacy and Tensions
- Tense with Virelle over festival tariffs and barge inspections.
- Cooperative with Ironholt on iron‑for‑ploughshares trade.
- Politely condescending toward Larksong’s leisure courts; wary of Brinemark’s privateers.

## Reunification Stance
- Officially neutral; unofficially curious. Elowen studies whether a restored crown could be a constitutional one with ducal guarantees.

## Adventure Hooks
- Granary Ghost: A sealed royal granary wing has spectral auditors blocking access to a critical ledger.
- The Missing Clause: Aunt Merevi hires discreet agents to locate a lost leaf of the Writ of Partition.
- Bread and Blood: Sabotage hits millstones before the Harvest Moot; is a famine panic being engineered?
