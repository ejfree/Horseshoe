# Old Church of the Horseshoe (Ember Synod)

## Overview
The Old Church is Horseshoe’s public conscience and private arcane steward. In sermons, it keeps oaths, annals, and shrines. In secrecy, it administers the realm’s controlled cache of aetherite — by policy capped to only 20–40 slivers and 4–5 splinters — issuing them under vows for sanctioned works. A comparable number of slivers and splinters are known (and carefully tracked) to exist in the vaults of nobility and elite families outside the Church.

## Doctrine
- Ember Doctrine: magic is a communal fire; no one may hoard it for vanity or dominion.
- Oath Before Working: every sanctioned working is bound to a name, purpose, and ledger line.
- Three Prohibitions: no Hollow rites; no issuance without witness; no ledger erased without triarch assent.

## Organization
- Triarchs of the Ember Seat: three elders who sign high writs and decide policy.
- Emberkeepers: parish clergy who tend hearth‑shrines, keep annals, and witness oaths.
- Lantern Collegium: ritualists and theoreticians who test, consecrate, and re‑anoint aetherite.
- Veilwardens: discreet escorts, investigators, and counter‑smugglers for reliquaries and writs.
- Cupbearers: quartermasters and auditors who manage seals, issuances, and inventories.

## Leadership
- Triarchs of the Ember Seat
  - Mother Caldra Yew: serene, incisive moderate; prizes transparency without endangering caches.
  - Father Orrin Glass: pragmatic diplomat; trades festival blessings for grain and road security.
  - Archdeacon Sava Pell: ascetic jurist; Purist‑leaning, seeks tighter caps on sliver issuance.
- Order Heads
  - Rector Iliyra Vance (Lantern Collegium): scholar of safe‑use; designs re‑anointing rites for Dormant splinters.
  - Marshal Daran Holt (Veilwardens): logistics hawk; runs decoy convoys and black‑market stings.
  - High Cupbearer Neris Quill (Cupbearers): inventory savant; maintains the shadow ledger of noble caches.
  - Master of Annals Joric Benne (Annalery): keeper of mirrored ledgers and treaty forms.
- Ducal Prelates
  - Prelate‑Archivist Mereth Ansel (Highspire, Evermead): balances annals work with granary rites.
  - Floodward Prior Celine Marr (Miregate, Virelle): leads levee blessings; liaises with guild masks.
  - Pass Abbot Korr Stenn (Lantern Pass, Ironholt): oath‑ring sanctifier; trains pass wardens.
  - Lady‑Seer Vaela Ro (Treaty Gardens, Larksong): salons and ceremony; rumored to own a royal hymnbook.
  - Abbess Ysri Tideborn (Wrecklight, Brinemark): sea‑wise convoy chaplain; scourge of false lights.
- Secretariat
  - Black‑Ledger Chancellor Fen Lowden: counter‑forgery expert; audits seals and signatures.
  - Proctor of Seals Halka Vrenn: maintains copper/silver/gold dies; prosecutes misuse.
  - Legate‑at‑Large Mirek Doss: travels between duchies to settle disputes before they spark.

## Assets and Protocols
- Holdings (Realm‑Wide): strictly limited to 20–40 slivers and 4–5 splinters under Church custody at any time. An equal number circulate among noble and elite family vaults.
- Reliquaries: deep caches under bathhouses, granaries, and chapels; most hold 3–6 slivers and at most one splinter, and some sit empty to confound thieves.
- Oath‑Ledger: ironbound volumes mirroring to three sites; every Church sliver is inscribed to a bearer and purpose.
- Seals: copper (parish), silver (collegium), gold (triarch). Splinters move only with three seals.
- Issuance: slivers may be lent to named bearers for bounded tasks; splinters require a procession and witnesses.

## Sites by Duchy
- Highspire Annalery (Evermead): central ledgers, treaty copies, and a training crypt for Emberkeepers.
- Tide‑Sanctum (Virelle): levee blessing halls; floodward rites; decoy reliquary barges.
- Oath‑Hearths of Lantern Pass (Ironholt): pass shrines that bind clan oaths; Veilwarden musters.
- Treaty Gardens Chapel (Larksong): neutral ground; salons double as theological councils.
- Wrecklight Shrine (Brinemark): sea‑shrine warding false lights; issues letters of safe conduct to convoys.

## Relationships
- Evermead: partners in annals and standards; Church clerks shape grain compacts.
- Virelle: blesses festivals and floodworks; negotiates gray‑lane tolerances.
- Ironholt: sanctifies oath‑rings; trains pass wardens in anti‑Hollow measures.
- Larksong: hosts neutral parley; curates relic‑lore and ceremonial frameworks.
- Brinemark: grants convoy letters; arbitrates anchor‑court disputes when tempers flare.

## Notable NPCs
- Mother Caldra Yew (Triarch): serene, incisive; rumored to remember every ledger line she’s signed.
- Father Orrin Glass (Triarch): genial deal‑maker; favors mercantile compacts that keep peace.
- Archdeacon Sava Pell (Triarch): stern canonist; wants Church‑only custody of splinters.
- Brother Tane Meryl (Veilwarden Captain): polite, implacable; hunts forgery rings and lost slivers.
- Sister Pel Orla (Cupbearer Auditor): cheerful bean‑counter; terrifies smugglers with perfect paperwork.
- Abbess Ysri of the Wrecklight (Emberkeeper): sea‑wise priest; thorn in every privateer’s side.
- Rector Iliyra Vance (Lantern Collegium): designs safe‑use rites; opposes festival grandstanding with splinters.
- Marshal Daran Holt (Veilwardens): sets decoy routes; never rides the obvious barge.
- Prelate‑Archivist Mereth Ansel (Highspire): dry wit; feared by sloppy scribes.
- Lady‑Seer Vaela Ro (Treaty Gardens): velvet words; iron memory for promises.

## Adventure Hooks
- The Third Seal: a splinter convoy lacks one authentic seal; find the forger before the rite fails.
- Ember Theft: three inscribed slivers vanish from a parish reliquary; the bearer swears innocence.
- False Ledger: a mirrored ledger shows entries that never happened; who is writing from the other side?
- Floodward Hymn: a storm‑chant goes dissonant days before monsoon; the Collegium needs field testers.

## Mechanics Notes (Aetherite)
- Slivers: issued under oath; tracked by inscription; misuse triggers censure and retrieval missions.
- Splinters: require supervised rites; can become Dormant on failure and need re‑anointing.
- Shards: officially “none in Church hands.” If one appears, expect triarch intervention and denials.

## Secrets (GM)
- The Church’s total holdings are actively managed to stay within 20–40 slivers and 4–5 splinters; most slivers are perpetually out on writ. The Cupbearers maintain a shadow ledger of noble caches of roughly equal size to anticipate black‑market shifts. A hidden annex beneath the Highspire Annalery mirrors the Oath‑Ledger to an older, forgotten book.
