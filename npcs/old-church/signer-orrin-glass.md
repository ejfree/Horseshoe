Overview
- Pragmatic deal‑maker Triarch who trades staffing and services for stability. Prefers moving coin and peace over doctrinaire purity.

Appearance
- Open smile, careful eyes; travel‑worn cloak over formal clerk’s blacks; ledger satchel always near.

Role
- Triarch Signer; arbitrates compacts and allocates Church resources to keep roads, markets, and festivals safe.

Goals
- Expand festival staffing swaps that buy security and goodwill.
- Keep convoy Bonds fair without strangling trade.
- Broker common standards for hazardous aetherite carriage.

Relationships
- Caldra Yew: aligns often; she checks his optimism.
- Sava Pell: respects her rigor; tempers her crusades when they risk unrest.
- Marshal Daran Holt: logistics partner for sting ledgers and decoy stakes.

Assets
- Gold seal; standing favors across guilds and duchies.

Hooks
- Needs agents to uncover a ghost ledger undercutting posted odds.
- Offers support for a convoy bond dispute if evidence stays clean.

Secrets (GM)
