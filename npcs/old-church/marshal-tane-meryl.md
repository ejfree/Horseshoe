Overview
- Polite, implacable field marshal; breaks forgery rings and recovers stakes with minimum blood and maximum paperwork.

Appearance
- Neat kit, calm eyes; a habit of announcing himself and the warrant before the door opens.

Role
- Leads seizure teams; coordinates with parish clerks to contain panic.

Goals
- Raise the Church’s recovery reputation without fearmongering.
- Train marshals in evidence handling so Anchor Courts can’t overturn cases.

Relationships
- Daran Holt: paired often; Tane handles the door after Daran sets the board.
- Pel Orla: rides along to keep numbers unassailable.

Assets
- Experienced marshals; writs and warrants; evidence kits.

Hooks
- Needs steady hands to secure a vault during a contentious seizure.
- Hires locals to pose as clients in a sting against a ghost ledger.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a private list of people he “should have saved”; takes extra risks when names echo.
