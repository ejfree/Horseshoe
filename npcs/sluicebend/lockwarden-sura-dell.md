Overview
- Riverwise lockwarden, a little superstitious about flood bells; knows every barge captain’s tells and every quirk of the gates.

Appearance
- Weathered skin, river boots, bell key on a thong; carries a sounding pole etched with flood years.

Role
- Runs the two‑gate lock; posts flows, assigns turns, and trains lock crews to spike gates in emergencies.

Goals
- Keep gates intact through spring surge; zero catastrophic jams.
- Replace two cracked gudgeons before festival week traffic.
- Quiet the “ninth bell” rumor that spooks green crews.

Relationships
- Halben Cross: united front on turn fairness; squabbles stay private.
- Pella Jute: coordinates yard windows for out‑of‑service gates.
- River Wardens: respects their muscle; demands they follow light codes.

Assets
- Lock crew, maintenance tools, spare pins and wedges, signal lamp codes.

Hooks
- Needs a chain‑boom pin found before a raft train hits the quay.
- Hires mechanics to help swap a gudgeon under time pressure.
- Seeks watchers to spot a saboteur who salts lamp oil with water.

Secrets (GM)
- Once spiked a gate to save a barge but drowned a smuggler under it; the crew’s silence frays.
