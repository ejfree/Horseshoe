Overview
- Low‑duchy buyer with sharp eyes and clean scales; pays decent coin for clean billets and true‑weight sacks. Loyal to profit, not to towns.

Appearance
- Polished boots, ledger case, traveling cloak embroidered with a discreet guild mark; polite, never hurried.

Role
- Leases bays in Factor Warehouses; advances coin on Hookhill shipments; ships south by convoy.

Goals
- Secure exclusive rights to high‑grade billets from Dorn’s best stands.
- Lock down ore lots from Eastwall with transparent assays.
- Keep Brinemark convoy contracts favorable without angering Virelle.

Relationships
- Pip Fen (Hookhill): respects his assays; pays for speed and discretion.
- Brin Allet: maintains cordial compliance; no funny business at the Weighhouse.
- Halben Cross: plays by posted rules—unless a rival cheats first.

Assets
- Warehouse bays with bonded locks, hired guards on festival weeks, letters of standing with southern houses.

Hooks
- Offers premium to escort a high‑value ore lot through a tense lock queue.
- Needs proof a rival salts sacks with river stones; wants them ruined legally.
- Hires scouts to assess a risky upslope cut before backing it.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps two ledgers: one clean, one for “test purchases” that might not survive audit.
