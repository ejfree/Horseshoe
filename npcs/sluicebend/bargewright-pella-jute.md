Overview
- Runs the boatyard on Boathouse Row; quotes fair, enforces safety fierce. Believes a good yard saves more lives than a dozen brave wardens.

Appearance
- Ropeâ€‘scarred palms, pitch in the hair, measuring stick tucked behind one ear; sharp gaze for rot and rushed work.

Role
- Repairs and refits barges, trains apprentices, and signs off hulls for lock passage.

Goals
- Cut refit time without cutting corners before festival queues.
- Source better pitch and seasoned timbers; keep Ironholt supply steady.
- Establish a yard fund for crews injured by bad owners.

Relationships
- Sura Dell: times refits to lock maintenance; shares lamp codes.
- Halben Cross: argues when he rushes unsafe boats; wins often.
- Tamber Kett (Hookhill): trades techniques; swaps tool steel for rope.

Assets
- Two covered slips, a stocks crane, coopers on call, and a trusted foreman.

Hooks
- Needs guards after saboteurs salt fresh timbers in the yard.
- Hires testers to try a new reefing rig in heavy flow.
- Seeks proof a rival stamps unseaworthy hulls for bribes.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a quiet list of owners she refuses to service; one is on the Burgess Council.
