Overview
- Bond Hall toll clerk; calm and exacting. Settles scale disputes without fuss and keeps the Weighhouse honest.

Appearance
- Clean cuffs, copper seal on cord, portable scale weights in a leather roll; steady hands, steady voice.

Role
- Weighs cargo, witnesses contracts, posts house edge for odds, and maintains Sluicebend’s standing book.

Goals
- Harmonize turn tokens and weight chits with Hookhill to cut fraud.
- Train a second clerk to keep the desk manned past dusk.
- Audit factor warehouses for quiet drift in “standard cask.”

Relationships
- Halben Cross: professional respect; clashes only over speed versus certainty.
- Sura Dell: coordinates flood‑year marks and bell codes.
- Sister Ellin Torv (Hookhill): mutual trust; honors her minor seals.

Assets
- Parish seal, mirrored ledgers, box of weights, dispute dais in the Weighhouse.

Hooks
- Needs witnesses and muscle for a surprise warehouse audit.
- Hires couriers to carry matched chits to Hookhill and back.
- Seeks to unmask a ghost ledger skimming Weighhouse fees.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a private tally of captains who pay crews poorly; looks for leverage to reform them.
