Overview
- “Old” Tren Goss — missing three fingers, gains three friends every night at the Boomsman. Knows which ropes to pull and which to cut.

Appearance
- Sun‑creased grin, stump glove on left hand, tankard that never seems to empty; eyes always on the next berth opening.

Role
- Schedules berths along the stone quay; manages booms and bollards; keeps peace among rival crews with jokes and threats.

Goals
- Stop queue wars from turning into knife fights.
- Replace worn bollard rings before one fails under load.
- Keep his nephew out of a smuggling ring he half‑remembers leading.

Relationships
- Halben Cross: plays good‑cop to his stern; passes whispers.
- Pella Jute: trades labor and favors when yards overflow.
- Galla Venn (Hookhill): old drinking buddy; swaps gossip for beds.

Assets
- Dockmen roster, spare lines, boom winches, favor tabs in half the taverns.

Hooks
- Needs deniable help to locate a stolen boom pin before flood watch.
- Hires intermediaries to settle a berth dispute before it spills.
- Offers coin to tail his nephew and break a smuggling chain gently.

Secrets (GM)
- Owes a quiet debt to a wreckers’ factor from his youth; they want a favor repaid.
