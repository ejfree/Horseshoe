Overview
- Brisk, ink‑sure market reeve who hates queue‑jumpers more than thieves. Keeps the bend orderly when thaw turns the quay into chaos.

Appearance
- Close‑cropped hair, inked fingertips, whistle on a cord; slate coat with tally marks stitched inside the cuff.

Role
- Chairs the Burgess Council of Wharfmasters; posts turn orders at the Lock Gates, adjudicates market fines at the Weighhouse.

Goals
- Keep lock turns fair and moving during flood and festival weeks.
- Stamp out petty graft at the booms before it becomes a ring.
- Maintain trust with Hookhill so cargo flows without extra Bonds.

Relationships
- Sura Dell (lockwarden): trusts her river calls; backs her against loud captains.
- Brin Allet (Bondwright): defers on scales and seals; presents clean books.
- Reeve Mera Holth (Hookhill): steady correspondence; swaps warnings and favors.

Assets
- Turn order slates, fine books, sworn quay bailiffs, and a horn key for the signal tower.

Hooks
- Needs deniable help after forged turn tokens start circulating.
- Hires escorts to walk the night queue when a brawl is brewing.
- Seeks proof a factor bribed a dockman to jump the line.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a private blacklist of captains who endanger crews; will tank their turns quietly.
