Overview
- Ferrier and smith; broad‑backed, burns bright coke when he can get it. Keeps teams shod and the levy’s old arbalests alive.

Appearance
- Soot‑streaked arms, leather apron, easy grin; keeps a wagon‑wheel stool and a rack of arbalest prods.

Role
- Shoes mules, sets nails, repairs saws and peaveys; maintains the arbalest bench by the gate‑stile.

Goals
- Replace cracked arbalest prods on the yard’s walk.
- Source quality charcoal to avoid brittle steel.
- Trade for better forge tools before winter.

Relationships
- Dorn: swaps tool upkeep for a share of fresh charcoal.
- Rusk: advances hardware against promised ore—carefully.
- Reeve: maintains levy kit; asks for fair pay in nails and grain.

Assets
- Smithy & Ferrier shop, stock of nails, and a decent bellows.

Hooks
- Pays in tools for a wagon of quality charcoal.
- Needs escort for a supply run to the charcoal rings at dusk.
- Seeks help testing a repaired arbalest stringing jig.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps an old arbalest stamped with a noble make; claims it’s salvage—papers are thin.
