Overview
- Flax‑grey braid, watchful; keeps Hookhill’s ledgers and postings under Bondwright witness. Practical, steady, sleeps poorly when stocks run thin.

Appearance
- Weathered hands ink‑stained from ledgers; plain wool with a key ring and tally knife. Voice kept low to avoid setting off tempers.

Role
- Village reeve and council chair; posts contracts at the Market Yard, calls levy, and oversees the Monolith Cellar by custom.

Goals
- Keep winter stores full and the levy sober through thaw and raids.
- Resolve a contested timber claim at Ghostfall Creek without blood.
- Keep ore and timber moving without overreaching Bondwright authority.

Relationships
- Sister Ellin Torv (Bondwright clerk): trusted witness; quiet moral compass.
- Dorn Bracken (head cutter): respects his skill, reins his reach.
- Igan Rusk (pit boss): indulges him once more on Eastwall—wants proof.

Assets
- Standing book, contract posts, alarm horn access; goodwill with most foremen.

Hooks
- Asks the PCs to witness and arbitrate a Ghostfall Creek claim.
- Needs escorts to carry market postings to upslope camps after goblin drums.
- Seeks a discreet look at odd glyphs reported near the Monolith Cellar.

Secrets (GM)
- Keeps a private list of families one bad season from flight; prioritizes them quietly.
- Fears the Monolith’s attention will draw powers Hookhill cannot survive.
