Hookhill is the starting town for the PCs. It is a small town in 

- [The Hollow Engine] buried beneath the starting town; predates current settlement. This is actually an early piece of terraforming gear that uses the significant ambient magic in the area. 

It is "known" as it was discovered in the basement of the mayor's house many years ago. It is a natural cavern with a strange metal obelisk buried partially in the ground.
