Hookhill is the starting village for the PCs. It is a small village, 1k people, in the High Marches. It is in a valley, very close to the Northern Mountain feature, the Grey Sluice. This is a series of "magical" ancient pathways out of the mountains that form the rivers of the Horseshoe. The mountains here are a grey black and this area forms a division to the north western mountains which are always snow capped. Lots of lumbering & mining.

[The Hollow Engine] buried beneath the starting town; predates current settlement. This is actually an early piece of terraforming gear that uses the significant ambient magic in the area. 

It is "known" as it was discovered in the basement of the mayor's house many years ago. It is a natural cavern with a seamless terraforming monolith buried partially in the ground.

When the first sliver of aetherite approachs, the monolith starts. This should provide a way for the party to solve the town raid and buy time to escape. If they fight it out they will die. The monolith opens a projected screen, they cant read but it adapts, that offers "root" access
