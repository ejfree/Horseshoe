Overview
- Itinerant assayer with a boxed scale and acid vials. Friendly, keeps ears open, and pockets shut.

Appearance
- Patch coat with hidden vials, jeweler’s loupe, careful hands; a polite cough before bad news on samples.

Role
- Tests ore at the Ore Landing & Stamp; mediates between foremen and hopefuls with a practiced neutrality.

Goals
- Stay on the right side of every foreman and the reeve.
- Build a reputation for fair weights and quick turnaround.
- Find a “green‑spark” pocket to make a name—and a stake.

Relationships
- Rusk: respectful skepticism; won’t gild results.
- Dorn: checks bog‑iron pockets and timber‑trapped ore for him.
- Galla: trades gossip for meals when coin’s thin.

Assets
- Boxed scale, acids, sample library, and a few markers owed.

Hooks
- Offers a finder’s fee for samples from a “green‑spark” pocket upslope.
- Needs guards after someone spikes his acids and falsifies chits.
- Hires porters to haul an unusually heavy “slag” rock to test.

Secrets (GM)
- Logged a sample that sang faintly near the Monolith Cellar; hasn’t shared it yet.
