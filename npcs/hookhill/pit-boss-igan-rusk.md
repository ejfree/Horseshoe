Overview
- Old, cinder cough; swears the Eastwall seam still runs rich. Tough as pit‑props, hates wasting a good drift.

Appearance
- Lantern scars on cheeks, coal grit in the lines of his hands; keeps a chalk stub and a battered gas test candle.

Role
- Former lead at Eastwall Drift; contracts day‑crews and keeps hush while he tries to reopen.

Goals
- Reopen a shored‑up drift without spooking the council.
- Prove the seam turns and redeem his standing.
- Replace rotted props and test for bad air properly this time.

Relationships
- Tamber Kett: credits for iron dogs, chains, and a new hoist brake.
- Pip Fen: trusts his assays if they’re not paid for by rivals.
- Reeve Holth: one last chance—if he can show safe timbers.

Assets
- Drift maps, a few loyal hands, and a stash of pit‑props.

Hooks
- Hires hands to clear a cave‑in before rivals seize his claim.
- Needs sober witnesses for gas tests to silence rumors.
- Offers shares for hauling ore sacks to the Ore Landing by night.

Secrets (GM)
- Heard a deep “song” in the drift once; fears the Hollow’s touch more than collapse.
