Overview
- Scarred forearms, slate eyes; runs three cutter teams and knows every ridge path and windfall. Work‑first, talk‑later.

Appearance

Role
- Leads logging crews, sets cuts, maintains the Cutters’ Yard gear and alarm horn.

Goals
- Secure a new stand beyond the old stormbreak before rivals.
- Keep crews paid and sober; avoid needless accidents.
- Map safe haul lines to the Ore Landing & Stamp.

Relationships
- Galla “Greenglass” Venn: bunkhouse beds and scrip tabs; mutual respect.
- Tamber Kett: keeps saws and wedges true; trades favors for charcoal.
- Reeve Holth: friction over permits; loyalty when raiders loom.

Assets
- Three seasoned teams, two mules, a whip‑saw frame, and ridge maps.

Hooks
- Needs guards to escort a saw team to a risky upslope cut.
- Hires hands to recover a stolen chain kit from camp thieves.
- Seeks a path around a fresh windfall blocking his haul.

Secrets (GM)
