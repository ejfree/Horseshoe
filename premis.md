Lets build a world for my next PF2E campaign. I think the overall idea that I want to explore is below

Overall Theme: A little more LOTR and grimdark.Fairly traditional fantasy archtypes. Turns out this was an old earth colony who is essentially rebuilding a feudal society 

Magic: Low Magic that scales - No planes or elemental bullshit. No fey bullshit. I want to provide a mechanism whereby the intrinsic magic in the air can be amplified by a substance, like a magic crystal. Party should gain more access to this material over time and essentially boost their spell casting ability. 

Geography
The land looks like a fat horseshoe tilted on its side. The Northern and Western sides are bordered with impenetrable mountains. (for now). Inside the horsehoe in a sea, that connects to a larger ocean that surrounds the southern and eastern borders. 

Nations: ...

Cities: ...

Starting Area: $town



Plot Structure

1. Start with goblins invading $town. It is led by a Goblic shaman with unknown dark magic. 
2. Eventually the horde of goblins is too big and they take over the town. Which also has a secret old goblin Mcguffin underneath the town.
3. These goblins are special and have dark magic, like the time before.
4. Goblin Lord is very strong commanding 100,000 goblins. They are ravaging the countryside. And will continue until stopped. 
5. Goblins are really being run behind the scenes by an undead lich, who retakes an elven fortress
