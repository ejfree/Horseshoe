Factions & Forces

Goblin Horde of the Blackjaw
- Leader: War-King Grakhul Chain-Wise; wears a necklace of Hollow shards chained to his ribs.
- Doctrine: Swift raids, tunnel flanking, shamans singing Hollow resonance to crack gates and minds.
- Strength: 100,000 across clans at peak; not all fieldable; logistics are fragile.
- Goal: Uncover and awaken old engines to make the surface theirs again.

The Pale Archivist
- Identity: Lich-mind “Verran,” once a custodian archive for First Landing.
- Assets: Hollow-core servitors, wights bound by resonance scripts, stolen elf wards.
- Objective: Seize Skyglass Bastion and the Hollow Engine under Hookhills to bootstrap a new, obedient lattice.

Wardens of the Vale
- Elven order maintaining skyglass roads, memory-singing, and high passes.
- Split between Isolationists (hold the vales) and Interventionists (strike out to kill the lich).

The Gilder Consortium
- Merchant cartel grasping for any sliver-and-shard trade; “safety standards” with flexible morals.
- Sponsors expeditions, hires free companies, bribes officials in Thalassar.

Old Church of the Horseshoe (Bondwright Synod)
- Public Role: oath halls and registries for Bonds, annals and standards, neutral arbitration, and public odds markets; vault banking via letters of standing.
- Hidden Asset: mirrored ledgers and secured stakes vaults; hazardous‑instrument licensing for slivers/splinters under Bonds with witnesses and indemnities.
- Political Leverage: witnesses compacts, arbitrates feuds; maintains neutral grounds like the Treaty Gardens in Auravale.
- Internal Currents: Bondwright Moderates (pragmatic licensing) vs. Purists (oppose most aetherite use); rivalry shapes policy.
- See also: `npcs/old-church/old-church.md` for detailed structure, sites, and hooks.

Order of the Glass Sigil (Tiny, Secretive)
- A cloistered magical order rumored to hold a handful of true Shards and the rites to wield them safely.
- Members are few, itinerant, and often embedded in other institutions to hide their assets.

Bondwright Moderates
- Seek practical, community-safe uses of aetherite; oppose Hollow rites but accept controlled shards.
- Opposed by Purists who reject all shards as blasphemy.

Free Companies of the Calder
- Sellswords with charters stamped in Veilport; reputations matter; crystal bounties posted each season.
