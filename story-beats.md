1. Hookhill - Initial goblin raids culminating in a full goblin army & capture of the city. Expect the party to escape via the Hollow Engine or overland with refugees. 
2. Surrounding area is captured. Goblins will continue to push deeper. 
3. Then the darkness expands and covers the NW area. Impacting the one duke. He will lead an attack against the goblins and die as his cavalry is decimated by casters
4. Then the rest of the duchies will have to figure out what to do. 
5. The way to approach this is to find a bunch of magic upgrades so that the armies have more mages themselves.
6. Eventually the people have to learn how to create this material. Can the party do that? If not I have another group?
7.
