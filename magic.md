Magic in Calderos

Principle
- Ambient aether pervades life but lies inert. Aetherite is a manufactured composite that amplifies and focuses it. Clean aetherite stabilizes; Hollow aetherite is spoiled or mis‑synthesized material that corrupts and overdrives.

Origins & Custodians
- First Landing fabricators created aetherite for the lattice and tools. Centuries later, elven masters in the Skyglass Vales guarded the craft as a secret art.
- The technique was lost during the Sundering and Long Night. The elves retain some armory stockpiles but can no longer make new aetherite.

Known Forms (Current Age)
- Sliver (Very Rare): needle-sized. Slivers enable casting in the 2nd–3rd‑level range. Only the very rich or well‑connected ever see them, and they are ruthlessly guarded, especially by the Old Church.
- Splinter 4th Level - Only know in the Old Church
- Shard (Legendary): small rock crystal. Shards enable casting in the 5th‑level range. They are almost mythical today; only 4-5 known to exist.
- Small lattice: 6th level spells - Only exists with the elves and secret stashes.
- Fist sized lattice: 7th level spells - Only exists with the elves and secret stashes.
- Small crystal lattice: 8th level spells - Only exists with the elves and secret stashes.
- Floating crystal lattice: 9th/10th level spells - Only exists with the elves and secret stashes.

Custody & Counts
- Church Holdings: strictly limited to 20–40 Slivers and 4–5 Splinters under the Old Church’s custody at any time.
- Noble Holdings: an approximately equal number (20–40 Slivers and 4–5 Splinters) are sequestered in noble and elite family vaults.
- Shards and Lattices: remain outside normal circulation; counts are uncertain or unique, usually under elven control or rumor.


Supply & Scarcity
- New aetherite cannot be fabricated with known methods. No Dust, Prisms, or Hearts are found in the wild. In Horseshoe, workable aetherite in circulation is fixed in count: 40–80 Slivers and 8–10 Splinters in total (half with the Old Church, half with nobles). Attempts to rework fragments often create Hollow byproducts.

Using Aetherite (Player-Facing)
- Sliver: during daily preparations, a spellcaster can attune to a Sliver to access higher-tier magic (2nd–3rd level) within their tradition. Slivers are status symbols; possession invites theft, intrigue, and oaths.
- Shard: with lengthy rites and heavy safeguards, a master spellcaster can draw on a Shard to work 4th–5th‑level effects. Shards are kept in vaults and brought out under guard for sanctioned workings.

PF2E Hooks (Guidance)
- Relic: Aether Sliver (Very Rare). Attune at daily prep. Choose one: gain one additional 2nd‑level spell slot; or if you already have 2nd‑level, gain one additional 3rd‑level slot. On a critical failure to Cast a Spell using the sliver-provided slot, you suffer Miscast (stupefied 1, enfeebled 1) until you rest 10 minutes.
- Relic: Aether Shard (Unique/Rare). Attune at daily prep with a 10-minute rite. Choose one: gain one additional 4th‑level slot; or if you already have 4th‑level, gain one additional 5th‑level slot. After use, attempt a DC high-level flat check; on failure, the Shard becomes Unstable and cannot be used again until re‑consecrated (costly ritual).
- Talisman: Emberbound Bead (Common). Once per day, negate one Miscast penalty.
- Archetype: Aether-Channeler (Uncommon). Dedication grants safe attunement to Slivers/Shards and a reaction to shunt Miscast to the aetherite (risking Unstable state).

Rituals & Rites
- Emberkeeping (Religion): stabilize a room’s resonance for 24 hours; grants +1 circumstance to recovery checks; requires a tended hearth and shared Names.
- Hollow Ward (Arcana/Occult): repels Hollow-touched for 8 hours; emits audible hum that may attract scavengers.

Costs & Risks
- Overuse causes “Hollowing”: tinnitus, tremors, nightmares; at extremes, lesions of crystal-laced bone and compulsions.
- Broken Shards can “sing” and call predators or alert shamans attuned to the same frequency.

No Planes, No Fey
- Spirits are local resonance echoes tied to places, oaths, or lineages. The Ember faith treats them as memory made warm, not gods.
