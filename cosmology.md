Cosmology & Faith (No Planes)

Heavens
- Stars wax and wane with resonance tides. Eclipses amplify aether unpredictably. Folklore claims comets “seed” Starfall, but the so‑called Starfall Fields are actually old vault‑burst scatter zones.

Spirits
- Place-echoes and oath-echoes, not outsiders. They remember heat and voices. Hearth rites nourish memory; neglect breeds haunts.

Emberkeeping
- Doctrine: Warmth binds people to sanity; shared memory resists Hollowing.
- Practice: Keep a tended fire; speak Names; ward the doorway with iron and ash.

Afterdeath
- Most pass as cool echoes, fading to silence unless anchored by vows or trauma. Necromancy is resonance theft—wrenching echoes into meat or bone.

Miracles
- Faith techniques stabilize the user and allies, granting modest boons; great “miracles” arise from perfect communal harmony with aether (handled as powerful rituals).
