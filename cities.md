Population Breakdown (Pentarch Duchies, total 80M)

- Notes: Late‑medieval tech/organization; averages across mixed terrain. The Southfens is the compact “city duchy” (high density, lower total). Whitehart Chase is the spacious “reserve duchy” (low density, similar total to Southfens).

- Greenwold — 28,000,000 people
  - Avg density: ~15/km² → implied area ~1.87M km²

  - Urbanization: ~12% → ~2.16M urban

  - Avg density: ~60/km² → implied area ~0.17M km² (compact and dense)
  - Urbanization: ~15% → ~1.5M urban
  - Major cities: Miregate ~500k, Lockhaven ~120k, Lanternreach ~90k, Floodward ~50k; plus canal towns totaling ~0.74M.

  - Avg density: ~4/km² → implied area ~2.5M km² (broad preserves, estates, and wilds)
  - Urbanization: ~8% → ~0.8M urban
  - Major cities: Auravale ~80k, Sunspire Springs ~50k, Hartbridge ~35k, Poetswood ~22k; plus spa villages and estate towns totaling ~0.61M.

- Remainder of landmass (~1.2M km²) accounts for high peaks, deep wilds, badlands, and ungoverned marches with sparse settlement that do not shift ducal averages.

Key Cities & Sites

Starting Town: Hookhill (Hookmarch, Barrowmarch)
- Pitch: A hill-country river-port clinging to an ancient stone hook pier, last true market before the Stone Ladder pass into Blackjaw.
- Population: ~2,400 within palisade; 6,000 in reach.
- Economy: Peat, iron bloom, ferries, salvage, whispers of sliver-trade (mostly fakes).
- Authority: Reeve Maera Dun (pragmatic), sworn to Baron Kest of the Barrowmarch.
- Notables: 
  - Bondwright Orun (oathkeeper; charismatic moderate).
  - Jerrik Fenn (smuggler-ferry; knows hidden inlets).
  - Apprentice Warden Sera Valis (studies local “song” phenomena).
- Landmarks:
  - The Hook: cyclopean pier from First Landing stone; echoes underfoot.
  - The Ashen Hall: longhouse, market, levy-muster.
  - Oldwell Steps: spiral stairs going… further than they should.
  - Sluicehead Ford: braided streams at the Grey Sluice headwaters; easy to defend, treacherous in thaw.
- Secret (GM): The Hollow Engine sits beneath Oldwell Steps—an auxiliary lattice sub-reactor. It hums to a goblin shaman’s song.

Thalassar: Veilport
- Merchant harbor with layered sea-walls and mirrored signal towers.
- Home to the Contract Archive; disputes arbitrated under watch of guild militias.

Hearthcliff Bond Hall
- Red-clay terraces, ward-lamps like constellations along the sea road.
- Registry city; craftsmen bind aetherite into safe household uses under bonded licenses.

Vales: Skyglass Bastion
- Elven cliff-fortress with transit lifts; command of high passes and vales.
- Currently mustering against a lich-led shadow army; internal debate splits the wardens.

Barrowmarch: Kesthold
- Hillfort of Baron Kest; granaries, armorers, levy training yards.
- Refuge node if Hookhills falls; uneasy with March-Lord’s taxes.
