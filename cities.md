Key Cities & Sites

Starting Town: Hookhill (Hookmarch, Barrowmarch)
- Pitch: A hill-country river-port clinging to an ancient stone hook pier, last true market before the Stone Ladder pass into Blackjaw.
- Population: ~2,400 within palisade; 6,000 in reach.
- Economy: Peat, iron bloom, ferries, salvage, whispers of sliver-trade (mostly fakes).
- Authority: Reeve Maera Dun (pragmatic), sworn to Baron Kest of the Barrowmarch.
- Notables: 
  - Father Orun (Emberkeeper; charismatic moderate).
  - Jerrik Fenn (smuggler-ferry; knows hidden inlets).
  - Apprentice Warden Sera Valis (studies local “song” phenomena).
- Landmarks:
  - The Hook: cyclopean pier from First Landing stone; echoes underfoot.
  - The Ashen Hall: longhouse, market, levy-muster.
  - Oldwell Steps: spiral stairs going… further than they should.
  - Sluicehead Ford: braided streams at the Grey Sluice headwaters; easy to defend, treacherous in thaw.
- Secret (GM): The Hollow Engine sits beneath Oldwell Steps—an auxiliary lattice sub-reactor. It hums to a goblin shaman’s song.

Thalassar: Veilport
- Merchant harbor with layered sea-walls and mirrored signal towers.
- Home to the Contract Archive; disputes arbitrated under watch of guild militias.

Ember Diocese: Hearthcliff
- Red-clay terraces, ward-lamps like constellations along the sea road.
- Pilgrimage city; craftsmen bind aetherite into safe household uses.

Vales: Skyglass Bastion
- Elven cliff-fortress with transit lifts; command of high passes and vales.
- Currently mustering against a lich-led shadow army; internal debate splits the wardens.

Barrowmarch: Kesthold
- Hillfort of Baron Kest; granaries, armorers, levy training yards.
- Refuge node if Hookhills falls; uneasy with March-Lord’s taxes.
